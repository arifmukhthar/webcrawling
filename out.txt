Recent findings suggest these microRNAs (miRNAs) have a critical role that affects the stroma rather than epithelial cells. Understanding the part played by the miR-143/miR-145 cluster in the tumor microenvironment is essential for the development of future miRNA-related therapies., The contribution of the microenvironment to promoting tumor growth has been recognized for decades [1]. Immune cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells, pericytes and, in some cases, adipocytes, are among the cell types that surround and interact with tumor cells, forming the tumor microenvironment [1]. A tumor generates a local response that leads to modifications of the extracellular matrix at the molecular, biological and mechanical levels, which in turn supports tumor growth and migration [1]. The surrounding cells secrete a cocktail of tumor-promoting factors, including cytokines, chemokines, pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory mediators, and extracellular vesicles, which all play a part in stimulating tumor progression [1]. Therefore, the cells present in the tumor stroma should be considered when studying the underlying biological mechanisms and therapeutic approaches for epithelial tumors., MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level, inhibiting mRNA translation or degrading mRNA. They are crucial players in tumorigenesis, and can act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors [2]. One set of miRNAs that has been intensively studied is the miR-143/145 cluster, which is formed by two co-transcribed but distinct miRNAs. This cluster has been described as having tumor suppressive functions in several tumor types that have an epithelial origin, such as cervical, colon, gastric, breast and pancreatic carcinomas [3]. This has been shown by miRNA expression analyses in tumor and normal tissue samples and in gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies, both in vitro and in vivo [3]. However, a recent well-designed study performed by Dimitrova, Gocheva and colleagues contradicts the concept of the miR-143/miR-145 cluster as a classical tumor suppressor [4]. miR-143 and miR-145 have been considered ideal candidates for cancer therapy, and several strategies for delivery of these miRNAs into cells are being explored [3]. Therefore, this study has important implications., To explore the endogenous role of the miR-143/miR-145 cluster, Dimitrova, Gocheva and colleagues initially used mice with a conditional knockout for miR-143/miR-145, but these animals failed to develop tumors, and differences in survival between these mice and controls were not detected [4]. Next, the researchers induced tumor-specific deletion of miR-143/miR-145 in a lung cancer mouse model (KrasG12D/+, p53â/â) in which tumors resemble human lung tumors. However, no differences in tumor burden or survival rate were found. In the same model, mice infected with a conditional lentivirus vector for forced expression of either miR-143 or miR-145 showed no difference in tumor burden when compared with controls. These results contradict earlier suggestions that the miR-143/miR-145 cluster has a tumor suppressor role [4]. Surprisingly, in the lung cancer mouse model, animals with a miR-143/miR-145 knockout (an organism-wide deletion) showed decreased number of tumors and reduced tumor area compared with controls. The same effect was also present after mice tail vein injection of KrasG12D/+, p53â/â cells with miR-143/miR-145 null alleles. Altogether, these results suggested that systemic miR-143/miR-145 expression could support tumor growth and launched the hypothesis that these miRNAs affected the stroma rather than epithelial cells [4]., To further explore the role of the tumor microenvironment, stromal cells were isolated and sorted, and the researchers found that endothelial cells, but not epithelial cells, were enriched in miR-143/miR-145. In miR-143/miR-145-deficient mice, active neoangiogenesis was reduced, and this effect could be partially explained by miRNA targeting of calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase ID (Camk1d), a protein involved in angiogenesis [4]. Specifically, miR-145 binds to the 3â untranslated region (UTR) of Camk1d and represses its expression. This study points to the miR-143/miR-145 cluster as a critical promoter of neoangiogenesis [4]. This finding is of crucial importance, as gain-of-function therapeutic strategies using this cluster could promote neoangiogenesis in the lung cancer microenvironment and support tumor growth instead of suppressing it., This is the second in vivo study arguing against a tumor-suppressor function for the miR-143/miR-145 cluster [5]. Although exogenous forced-expression studies had suggested that the miR-143/miR-145 cluster is a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer, Chivukula, Shi and collaborators studied the role of these miRNAs in intestinal physiology and failed to detect abnormalities in the development or architecture of the small and large intestine in miR-143/miR-145-deficient mice [5]. However, these mice could not recover from intestinal injury. Moreover, these researchers detected miR-143 and miR-145 in mesenchymal cells but not in epithelial cells of the intestine [5]. Together, these results suggests that the stromal microenvironment is regulated by these miRNAs rather than the intestinal epithelium. Depletion of miR-143 and miR-145 caused dysfunction of smooth muscle cells and myofibroblasts, which in turn impaired the regeneration of the intestinal epithelium. This effect was explained, at least in part, by miR-143 targeting of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5), which in turn negatively regulates the insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway, known to be critical for intestinal epithelial proliferation [5]., In the majority of gene expression studies in cancer, RNA is isolated from heterogeneous tumor samples. This approach can generate misleading conclusions, as expression of a miRNA exclusively in one specific cell type can appear as bulk expression [6]. Therefore, when studying gene expression levels in epithelial tumor cells, the stromal bias should be considered. Analysis of gene expression levels after fluorescence-activated cell sorting for distinct cell populations could overcome this issue [4]. Another approach could be the use of laser capture microdissection, which enables single cell isolation based on morphology or presence or absence of cell markers [7]. Finally, in situ hybridization could also be used to determine expression of miRNAs in specific cell types and their location within the tissue sample [8]., Delivery of exogenous miRNAs is considered as one of the most promising novel strategies for treatment of human cancer [9]. However, it is important to consider the endogenous expression and the effects of miRNAs in vivo on the tumor microenvironment, as elegantly revealed by Dimitrova, Gocheva and collaborators [4]. Therefore, care should be taken when selecting miRNAs for exogenous therapeutic delivery. A direct-targeting system specific for tumor cells is essential to avoid exposure of the tumor microenvironment to treatment. Some miRNAs might cause apoptosis and reduce proliferation of tumor epithelial cells but at the same time increase pro-tumorigenic mediators secreted by stromal cells. Moreover, the number and type of stromal cells present in the tumor microenvironment might differ in respect to the tumor type. Therefore, the expression and effects of miRNAs in the stroma should be dissected in every type of tumor and the potential of miRNA communication through miRNA secretion in the microenvironment should be tested. This type of communication was shown, for example, for miR-21, which is secreted by epithelial malignant cells and induces the release of miR-155 by monocytes; miR-155 is then transferred to the same epithelial cells and induces resistance to therapy [10]. The interplay between malignant cells and the microenvironment is more complicated than initially imagined, and further captivating findings will surely follow., MicroRNA"

Significantly, cancer genomes are dominated by mutation signatures distinct from those that accumulate in normal tissues with age, with potentially important translational implications."	"Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, University of Washington, Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington"	"2016-03-17"	"Signatures of mutagenesis provide a powerful tool for dissecting the role of somatic mutations in both normal and pathological processes. Significantly, cancer genomes are dominated by mutation signatures distinct from those that accumulate in normal tissues with age, with potentially important translational implications., The initiation and progression of human cancers are fueled by mutations and driven by adaptive selection. Consequently, many of the heritable phenotypic changes required to transform normal cells become etched in the cancer genome. Advances in high-throughput sequencing over the past decade have brought a greater appreciation for the number and types of DNA alterations that accumulate during cancer evolution. These somatic alterations are typically classified as either âdriverâ mutations, which confer selected cancer phenotypes, or the far more numerous âpassengerâ mutations, which hitch-hike with driver mutations but in and of themselves are not thought to be directly selected. Both the multiplicity and heterogeneity of these changes have unfortunately confounded attempts to reduce the evolutionary complexity of most cancers to a targetable number of recurring driver mutations. Additionally, whether normal mutation rates and processes are sufficient to explain the mutation patterns found in cancer has been debated for decades. In the last few years, DNA sequence analyses of cancer genomes have allowed the detection of distinct mutational signatures and, more recently, those occurring during aging. These findings have implications for our understanding of cancer initiation, evolution, and potentially for therapy., Stratton and colleagues at the Sanger Center, among others, have recently developed bioinformatic and computational tools to deconvolute mutational signatures that are over-represented in cancer genomes [1, 2]. Building on a large biochemical literature, they have inferred that some of the distinct mutational processes operative during the evolution of a tumor can be resolved by analyses of the bases immediately 5â² and 3â² of the mutated base [3]. Their initial studies show that more than 20 mutational signatures, representing a diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, can be identified across multiple cancer types., Unlike cancer cells, normal cells replicate their genomes with extraordinary accuracy and have an armamentarium of postreplicative DNA repair pathways to ensure genetic stability. Neither DNA replication nor postsynthetic DNA repair is, however, without error and some of the more than 50,000 estimated DNA damage events which occur daily within each normal cell can result in mutation. The majority of these mutations, destined to become passenger mutations should the resulting lineage ever be expanded, confer no demonstrable phenotype. The catalog of mutations present in a cancer genome at the time of sampling, therefore, is the sum of ânormalâ mutational processes occurring from the time an egg is fertilized and mutational processes occurring in tumors from the time a cancer is initiated. Some of these normal mutagenic processes will occur intermittently, e.g., caused by exposure to environmental mutagens, while others, such as replication errors, would be predicted to generate mutations at a more constant rate., Now, using data from The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) of 10,250 cancer genomes across 36 cancer types, Alexandrov et al. have extended these analyses to deconvolute from cancer genomes the signatures of mutations that likely occurred during normal aging from those that were acquired during malignant transformation [4]. They identified two mutational signatures, designated Signatures 1 and 5, for which the number of attributable mutations was proportional to the chronological age of the cancer patient at diagnosis. Interestingly, both signatures exhibit different mutation frequencies in different tissues and are not themselves correlated; only three cancer types show an age-correlation for both signatures (i.e., breast cancer, low-grade glioma, and medulloblastoma). This is likely to suggest that the underlying mechanisms of mutation are different for each signature., Signature 1 is largely made up of C>T substitutions at CpG dinucleotides, which are likely caused by spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine, enzymatic deamination of cytosine, or polymerase errors [5]. The cancer types exhibiting high Signature 1 mutation frequencies are chiefly derived from epithelia with high turnover and the signature may well mark the number of cell replications. Signature 5 primarily features a combination of C>T and T>C transitions, exhibits a degree of transcriptional strand bias, and may result from an endogenously generated metabolite(s). In contrast to Signature 1, the frequency of Signature 5, which also displays substantial variation between cancer types, is highest mainly in cancers of the brain, kidney, and thyroid., A striking finding of the studies is that no more than a quarter of the mutations found in cancer genomes exhibit any correlation with age or carry signatures of the physiological mutagenic processes operative during normal aging. Whether the mutation rate of cancer cells is elevated relative to normal has been continuously debated since the original description of the mutator phenotype hypothesis [6]. Defects in pathways governing genetic stability were reasoned to facilitate tumorigenesis by fueling the reiterative process of mutation, selection, and clonal expansion that drives cancer progression. One of the earliest and most emphatic conclusions of cancer genome sequencing studies was that, as predicted by the mutator phenotype hypothesis, cancers carry vast and varied numbers of mutations., The quantification of the relative contribution of physiological mutagenic processes to the cancer genome now reinforces the concept that elevated rates of mutation accumulation underpin the cancer phenotype. The distinct mutational signatures of age-associated and tumor-associated mutations also emphasize the fundamental differences between the mechanisms shaping normal and cancer genomes. Importantly these findings are also inconsistent with the proposal that the majority of risk among different tissues to the development of tumors can be explained by the number of normal stem cell divisions in those tissues [7]. The large numbers of mutations found in cancers was originally cited in support of this; however, the lack of a common and dominant age-related mutational signature argues against random mutations arising during DNA replication in normal, non-cancerous stem cells as the chief source of mutagenesis. The differences in age-related mutational signatures between different tissues must represent intrinsic differences in the lifetime exposures to endogenously and exogenously generated DNA damaging agents as well as differences in the postsynthetic DNA repair and replicative capacities of different cell types., Aging is the greatest risk factor for malignancy. Modulating the mutagenic processes underlying Signatures 1 and 5 could therefore offer the possibility of delaying cancer initiation and other age-related pathologies. Additionally, changes in mutation signatures might aid in early cancer diagnosis or in the quantification of genotoxic exposures especially through the application of âliquidâ biopsies. The results of Alexandrov et al. suggest that, in contrast to the prevailing focus of oncology on blocking key signaling hubs in growth pathways of tumor cells, mutation accumulation itself represents an underappreciated therapeutic target. As high levels of mutation are potentially deleterious, it has been proposed that the mutation frequency of the cancer genome is thresholded at a level below which cancers can maximize their genetic diversity but still maintain fitness, i.e., the population avoids undergoing an âerror catastropheâ [8]. In addition, while it is known that prognosis and mutation load are correlated in both colorectal and endometrial cancers, it is increasingly being appreciated that a high neoantigen load, secondary to a high mutation load, is also a major determinant of response to immunomodulatory therapies in certain cancers [9]. These observations have led to the proposal that both the frequency and rate of mutation of cancer cells, rather than individual driver mutations, might be an effective target. Treatment of cancer cells with mutagenic nucleoside analogs, for example, might result in ablation of the tumor through induction of an immunologically mediated error catastrophe [8]., Thus far, the identification of specific mutational signatures attributable to specific biological processes is largely correlative; of particular note, the age-correlated signatures identified by Alexandrov et al. were obtained from tumor genomes and not from histologically normal, aged tissues. Further analyses and experimentation in model organisms are required before one can infer a causal mechanism. It will be necessary, for example, to modulate the rate-limiting step in specific biological pathways to determine if this results in alterations of the corresponding mutational signature. Ultimately, the direct investigation of in vivo somatic mutation rates and signatures, for both tumor and normal tissue, will require accurate sequencing of single cells and molecules [10]., Cancer is first and foremost a disease of DNA, where evolutionary changes are driven by selection of stochastically generated pre-existing variants. It has long been argued that the rates and mechanisms of mutation operative in normal cells cannot account for the large numbers and types of mutations found in cancer and that defects in pathways governing genetic stability must be dysregulated to facilitate tumorigenesis. For the first time, it has become possible to quantify mutational signatures that likely occurred during normal aging relative to those that were acquired during malignant transformation and tumor progression. The capacity to accumulate mutations, rather than to mutate any particular subset of genes, has once again been confirmed as one of cancerâs key hallmarks."

We use CoINcIDE to discover novel breast and ovarian cancer subtypes with prognostic significance and novel hypothesized ovarian therapeutic targets across multiple datasets. CoINcIDE and curatedBreastData are available as R packages., Subtyping patient disease populations using high-dimensional molecular data and unsupervised clustering algorithms has transformed how researchers and clinicians interpret and quantify heterogeneity within a disease. Early gene expression cancer subtyping research showed that gene expression patterns can stratify patients into subtypes with distinct survival patterns [1]; such subtypes have the potential to drive personalized patient treatment regimens [2] and risk prediction models [3]. Unfortunately, while many studies report novel subtypes for various diseases [2, 4, 5], these subtypes are rarely routinely implemented in clinical practice. A major hurdle is that subtypes derived from high-dimensional data platforms are oftentimes not replicable [6]. In a recent opinion article discussing trustworthy experiments, replicability is defined as âthe chance that an independent experiment targeting the same scientific question will produce a consistent resultâ [7]. In the case of patient subtypes, this means subtypes with similar signaling patterns can be found across multiple datasets. Replicability is a key aspect of defining whether an analysis is trustworthy or not; if a clinician cannot trust the analysis that produced the subtypes, then there is little hope for widespread adoption and a true translation from bench to bedside., There are two large hurdles to producing replicable patient subtypes: a lack of curated disease-specific dataset collections and a lack of methods that discover consensus across clusterings from multiple datasets. When a collection of several datasets is available, there exist few widely adopted approaches to clustering multiple datasets to derive patient subtypes. Arguably the most popular approach is to concatenate all of the datasets into a single data matrix and then cluster this matrix. While this method can find interpretable signal [8], a large drawback is that the datasets must first be transformed using batch correction techniques to remove dataset-specific noise [8, 9]. While these methods smooth out signal variances across datasets that may indeed be noise artifacts, these variances might also be true signaling patterns. An example of the latter case is when datasets are from different targeted clinical trials with different latent disease subtypes. An additional drawback to concatenation is that it provides a single clustering, and thus valuable information about the consensus of the datasets within each subtype is lost. In supervised replicability analyses, it is common to not concatenate data matrices, but to confirm consensus of signaling patterns within, and then across, each dataset by conducting a meta-analysis with metrics such as effect size [10]. Here, an effect size for each feature (gene) is first computed within each dataset using binary supervised labels, and then a summary effect size across all datasets is computed; features with a large summary effect size are interpreted as being robust to dataset-specific noise artifacts and more likely to represent signal that highly distinguishes patients that do not share the same binary label. This meta-analysis approach has shown promise in high-dimensional molecular datasets across various platforms without any batch correction transformations to discover repeatable signal in supervised analyses [11]., However, an analogous meta-analysis method does not exist in the unsupervised realm for patient subtypes; consensus clustering and ensemble clustering evaluate cluster stability within a single dataset [12, 13] and methods to discover repeatable feature, for example, gene, subtypes, oftentimes rely upon the fact that feature labels are shared across datasets [14], which is not the case for patient labels across different institutions or clinical trials. There have been efforts to cluster across clinical datasets, but these methods assume the starting point of the analysis is an existing set of pre-defined edges (relationships) between nodes, which is normally not the case for de novo clustering analyses [15]. We propose a novel methodological framework called CoINcIDE that discovers robust patient subtypes, or meta-clusters, across multiple datasets. CoINcIDE builds upon the In-Group-Proportion metric [16], a method that quantifies the replicability of a single set of subtypes applied to a single external dataset. CoINcIDE does not require batch correction techniques, as it expands upon the meta-analysis approach to discover consensus across individual clusterings from each dataset, as opposed to a single concatenated matrix., Here we present a comprehensive framework called CoINcIDE: Clustering Intra and Inter DatasEts (Fig. 1). CoINcIDE enables researchers to discover truly replicable subtypes and is implemented as an R package providing functionality from initial data processing to final meta-cluster functional analyses. Next, we present a high-quality database collection of 24 breast cancer gene expression datasets encompassing 15 studies with linked outcomes and treatment information as a second R package. We apply CoINcIDE on this breast cancer collection and a previously developed ovarian cancer dataset collection [17]. We show that CoINcIDE validates known breast cancer subtypes and discovers ovarian cancer subtypes with prognostic significance and novel hypothesized therapeutic targets, all across multiple datasets.

                      CoINcIDE steps. The four main steps to CoINcIDE, a method to discover replicable patient subtypes by finding consensus across dataset-specific clusterings from multiple datasets. The first step of CoINcIDE is to derive these dataset-specific clusterings. The second step is to compute cluster-cluster similarities between each cluster-cluster pair, resulting in an adjacency matrix (clusters within the same dataset are not compared). The third step is to assign an edge between cluster pairs whose similarity passes set magnitude and significance thresholds, with the weight of the edge equaling the similarity magnitude. This creates a network. The fourth step is to then discover meta-clusters via network community detection methods. The resulting meta-clusters are the final subtypes
                    , We have developed a comprehensive suite of resources, tools, and methods to enable researchers to conduct robust meta-cluster analyses and discover replicable patient subtypes in the form of two R packages: CoINcIDE, which implements a set of novel methods for the discovery of patient subtypes across multiple datasets and curatedBreastData, a breast cancer dataset collection providing 24 high-quality curated breast cancer microarray datasets., We used 17 gene expression microarray datasets from the curatedBreastData Bioconductor package; this package includes primary human tissue breast cancer datasets collected from the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [18]. Datasets with sample sizes over 30 and a minimum 35-gene set from the full PAM50 gene set [19] (Additional file 1: Table S1) were used for analyses. Datasets with sample sizes under 30 did not comprise unique studies, but rather were small sets of microarrays from larger studies (also included in curatedBreastData) that had been run on different platforms. These filters resulted in 2,235 pre-treatment patient tumor sample microarrays encompassing 17 datasets and 15 studies across six different platforms. See Table 1 for dataset names and platform details; sample sizes ranged from 46 to 286 and the average number of genes per platform was approximately 11,000.Table 1

                    , CoINcIDE encompasses four steps to discover and visualize replicable patient subtypes by finding consensus across dataset-specific clusterings from multiple datasets. The clusters are represented as nodes in a network, and the final subtypes are meta-clusters of tightly connected clusters within this network. The four main steps of CoINcIDE are outlined in Fig. 1., The input to our proposed method is a collection of datasets. Each matrix has genes or features in the rows and patients or samples in the columns. Based on extensive analysis (Additional file 1: Table S2; Additional file 2: Supplemental Methods), for microarray gene expression applications, we suggest consensus clustering [12] implemented with Hartigan Wongâs k-means algorithm [20] using one random start and 90 % resampling of samples along with a rounded Proportion of Ambiguous Clusters (PAC) score [21] as the optimal single-dataset clustering method (see Additional file 1: Table S2, Additional file 2: Supplemental Methods, and Additional file 3: Figures S1 and S2 for details)., Each individual dataset is clustered using a gene set that represents a union of the genes present across all microarrays. The user can decide the minimum number of genes that have to overlap between different datasets with suggested thresholds ranging from 70 % to 100 %. If the user does not have a pre-defined gene set, CoINcIDE also includes a meta-ranking gene selection method (see Additional file 2: Supplemental Methods for details)., The CoINcIDE cluster-cluster metrics and significance test build upon the In-Group-Proportion (IGP) [16]. After each dataset is clustered in CoINcIDEâs step 1, clusters from dataset 1 and clusters from dataset 2 are compared as follows: centroids are derived from the clusters within dataset 1. Then, each cluster from dataset 2 is compared to these centroids. Patients from dataset 2, cluster A (â2-Aâ) are each assigned using Pearsonâs correlation to their respective nearest centroid in dataset 1. The centroid for which the highest fraction of patients from cluster â2-Aâ are assigned is deemed the best cluster fit for cluster â2-Aâ; let us assume in this case cluster â1-Câ is the best fit. Two cluster-cluster metrics are then calculated: a nearest neighbor fraction, which is the number of patients in cluster â2-Aâ assigned to cluster â1-Câ divided by the total number of patients in cluster â2-Aâ, and a similarity metric, which is the overall mean of Pearsonâs correlation matrix between cluster centroid â1-Câ and all patients in cluster â2-Aâ. This is done for each cluster in dataset 2., For the optimal â2-Aâ-â1-Câ cluster-centroid set match, a P value is computed by generating null centroid sets based on the centroid sets in dataset 1 using the IGP null distribution methods [16]; the final P value is the number of times the real patients from â2-Aâ were assigned to a null centroid set that resulted in a mean similarity metric and a nearest neighbor fraction greater than the true â2-Aâ-â1-Câ values. We suggest 500 null centroid iterations to compute this P value. CoINcIDE uses the third null centroid set method proposed by Kapp and Tibshirani; this is the same method used in the authorsâ R package, clusterRepro [16]. Finally, the roles of datasets 1 and 2 are reversed so that the centroids are derived from dataset 2 and the clusters in dataset 1 are treated as individual datasets. Cluster â2-Aâ and cluster â1-Câ are only considered to be potentially similar clusters if they are identified as the most similar cluster-cluster pair in both iterations with datasets 1 and 2. Assuming this is the case, the nearest neighbor fraction and similarity metric are averaged, and only these cluster-cluster pairs are evaluated in step 3., Cluster-cluster pairs that pass user-defined nearest neighbor fraction, mean similarity metric and P value thresholds are assigned an edge. The weight of this edge is the mean similarity metric. We recommend an averaged nearest neighbor fraction of 0.7 and a P value threshold of 0.01 (applied to both P values from the cluster-cluster pair) to produce highly significant clusters with strongly homogenous patient make-up. A user can test various mean similarity thresholds, which will produce slightly different CoINcIDE meta-clusters. Because CoINcIDE takes into the account the similarity value of each edge (see Step 4), a few edges with low mean similarity weights will not highly alter the final meta-cluster patient assignments. On the other hand, aggressively pruning edges by using a similarity threshold near the maximum possible value of one will certainly remove clusters, and perhaps entire datasets, that contain reliable signaling patterns, albeit with some added noise., We recommend an unbiased method to select the minimum mean similarity threshold, which involves inspecting the frequencies of mean similarity values across all datasets between all clusters (including mean similarities between non-optimal clusters.) We fit these frequencies to a Gaussian density curve for visualization and inspection; we recommend using a threshold value close to the similarity metric value that occurs at a local maximum or peak that is greater than a 0.1 baseline threshold., For the two breast cancer PAM50 analyses we used similarity thresholds of 0.15 and 0.25 based on these density curves (Additional file 3: Figure S3A-B). The final meta-cluster patient assignments are not highly affected by small changes in the similarity threshold; running the first breast cancer analysis also using a threshold of 0.25 produced the same results. For the 50, 264, and 2020-gene set non-PAM50 analyses, similarity thresholds of 0.4, 0.5, and 0.5 were chosen, respectively, as these values represented a local maxima in the density curve for these experiments (figure not shown.) Using the density curve method again, we chose a threshold of 0.5 for both ovarian analyses (Additional file 3: Figure S3C-D). In the second ovarian analysisâs density curve, there are two local maxima above the recommended 0.1 threshold, one at 0.5 and one at 0.7 (Additional file 3: Figure S3D). We thus ran two separate CoINcIDE analyses using each maxima as a threshold to better understand how the resulting networks differ., The Girvan-Newman community detection algorithm is then used to identify meta-clusters. This algorithm takes as input the edge and edge weight matrices derived from a sample-sample adjacency matrix, and outputs the final discovered meta-clusters [22] (Fig. 1). CoINcIDE implements the Girvan-Newman algorithm using the R package igraph [23]. To ensure meta-clusters of a reasonable size, meta-clusters with clusters from less than three unique datasets are removed from the final network., Seven different sets of clustered datasets were simulated from a real gene expression dataset containing four tissue types using Eigen decomposition methods (see Additional file 2: Supplemental Methods for details.) Each set contained 10 datasets constructed in a similar manner. Unless noted, a cluster was defined to contain all patient samples of the same tissue type. All clusters contained the logged expression of 200 simulated genes (see Additional file 3: Figure S4 for example simulated expression heatmaps.) The first set contained datasets with evenly sized clusters of 50 patient samples each for all four possible tissue types (Additional file 3: Figure S4B). The second set contained clusters derived in a similar manner to set one, but each cluster was assigned a random size ranging from 1 to 100 samples; the third set extended the methods of the second set by allowing a random number of clusters per dataset ranging from 2 to 4 clusters, and the fourth set allowed the number of clusters to randomly range between 1 and 4. The fifth and sixth sets combined the different cluster sizes from set three with the number of clusters in each dataset ranging from 2 to 4 and then 1 to 4, respectively. In the seventh and final set, two of the clusters from set 1 were replaced by clusters with a random mixture of tissue types (Additional file 3: Figure S4C)., For each of these seven sets, random normal noise with a mean of zero and increasing standard deviation from 0 to 2.4 was added to each of the 10 datasets. Each set was simulated 50 times, and true positive rates (TPR) and false positive rates (FPR) from the CoINcIDE meta-clusters were computed and averaged across all 50 iterations. A true positive was defined as an edge being connected between two clusters of the same tissue type. Finally, several minimum mean similarity thresholds ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 were tested. The minimum nearest neighbor fraction was held at 0.7, the individual P value maximum threshold was held at 0.01 and subtypes with less than three unique datasets were removed to match the thresholds used in all CoINcIDE analyses with real data., We first implemented CoINcIDE under a highly controlled, semi-supervised clustering scenario to ensure that CoINcIDE can re-discover known signal. We used the PAM50 centroid sets that define five breast cancer subtypes using 50 genes [24] to derive highly distinct, clear clusters; these are well-established centroid sets [3, 25, 26]. The original PAM50 centroids for each of the five breast cancer subtypes (Normal, Basal, Luminal A, Luminal B, and HER2) were downloaded online from the UNC Microarray Database [27]. HUGO gene symbols were updated to their latest version using the HGNChelper R package [28]. No dataset had less than 35/50 of these genes; this minimum 35-gene set contained the key hormonal signaling genes ESR1 and ERBB2 (Additional file 1: Table S1). Each group of patients assigned to a specific PAM50 subtype (centroid) within a dataset was defined as a cluster (the maximum number of PAM50 genes found in each dataset was used to make these assignments.) Pearsonâs correlation was used to assign a patient to the optimal PAM50 subtype, as this is the similarity metric used by the commercial PAM50 platform algorithm [29]., The PAM50 feature set was used again, allowing the maximum number of PAM50 genes found in a specific dataset to cluster that individual dataset. Each dataset was now de novo clustered using the suggested methods from CoINcIDE Step 1., CoINcIDE was compared with the method of concatenating datasets and then clustering them to compare their abilities to discover replicable and biologically intuitive subtypes. Because concatenation requires that all features are found across all datasets, CoINcIDE was re-run using only the minimum 35-gene PAM50 gene set found across all 17 datasets (Additional file 1: Table S1) for a fair evaluation; a similarity threshold of 0.3 was implemented based on the density plot (figure not shown)., All 17 breast cancer datasets were included in the concatenated data matrix. Concatenated matrices were tested with three transformation methods: no transformation, gene-wise Batch Mean Centering (BMC) and ComBat [9]; each transformation was run before clustering the concatenated matrix (see Additional file 2: Supplemental Methods for details). The effects of the BMC and ComBat transformations on the actual PAM50 centroid classifications were also investigated by using the PAM50 centroid classification of each patient as the actual subtype, before any transformations, after BMC, and alternatively after ComBat. A supervised analysis using the baseline non-transformed datasets was also run using the full PAM50 gene set, to ensure that using the smaller intersecting PAM50 gene set on the BMC and ComBat supervised analyses did not significantly alter AUC values. Survival analyses were conducted for all breast cancer analyses (see Additional file 2: Supplemental Methods for details). Finally, to inspect the effect of BMC on CoINcIDE, BMC was applied to each individual dataset using the maximum number of PAM50 genes found in each dataset and then CoINcIDE was run, using the same parameters as the initial de novo PAM50 CoINcIDE analysis. The effect of ComBat on CoINcIDE was not inspected because ComBat cannot be run on an individual dataset., CoINcIDE was then run using the same k-means clustering scheme as in the above methods section with three meta-ranked gene lists to test CoINcIDE on differing gene set sizes that contained none of the PAM50 genes included in the earlier clustering gene sets. Gene sets of 50, 264, and 2,020 genes were selected via the meta-ranking algorithm (PAM50 genes were removed before the meta-ranking algorithm was run.) The 50-gene set test was included because the PAM50 gene set includes 50 genes. This gene set could not include the top 20 dataset-specific genes for each dataset, as this resulted in more than 50 genes (Additional file 1: Table S3; see Additional file 2: Supplemental Methods for details on the meta-rank algorithm), but the latter two feature sets did include these additional top-ranked genes by dataset. Initial global meta-rank sets of 200 and 2,000, respectively, were chosen, and then any non-intersecting genes that were ranked in the top 20 genes by mean absolute difference for a specific dataset were included. This resulted in two features sets with 264 and 2,020 genes (Additional file 1: Tables S4 and S5, respectively.), Finally, we tested CoINcIDE using the same k-means clustering scheme as in the above methods section with two meta-ranked gene lists to test CoINcIDE differing gene set sizes. The two gene sets were chosen in exactly the same manner as the breast cancer 200 and 2,000 initial global-rank sets with additional dataset-specific intra-ranked genes. This resulted in two features sets with 240 and 2,014 genes (Additional file 1: Tables S6 and S7, respectively.), CoINcIDE is a novel framework that identifies patient subtypes, or meta-clusters, from clustering individual datasets and then assigning edges between similar clusters across datasets to create a network and identify subtypes through community detection (Fig. 1) [22]. The resulting subtype network provides a robust platform for evaluating the effect sizes of genes within each subtype across multiple datasets and an intuitive visualization technique to better understand cluster-cluster and dataset-dataset interactions. To demonstrate our work to cluster across multiple datasets and discover replicable subtypes, we first use simulated datasets, and then we use two collections of cancer data: a breast cancer collection and an ovarian cancer collection. The breast cancer collection constitutes 2,719 patients from 24 breast cancer gene expression studies encompassing 34 datasets (Table 1) [30]. The ovarian cancer collection contains 3,105 patients from 24 gene expression microarray datasets (Table 2) [17]. We first validate CoINcIDE using simulated data to illustrate the performance of CoINcIDE in a controlled environment. Subsequently we apply CoINcIDE on these two cancer dataset collections to showcase its abilities on a disease with well-known subtypes, that is, breast cancer, and one without established subtypes, ovarian cancer., We used a gene expression dataset containing four different lung tissue types to simulate highly distinct patient clusters using different scenarios: equal cluster sizes, mixed cluster sizes, and then mixes of both number of cluster sizes and numbers of clusters per dataset (see Methods and Additional file 3: Figure S4). Across seven simulation scenarios for varying levels of noise and mean similarity metric thresholds, CoINcIDE re-discovered the tissue-specific subtypes with high TPRs and low FPRs (Fig. 2). A minimum similarity threshold of 0.3 maintained high TPRs and zero FPRs for all simulations; only when this threshold was lowered to 0.0 did we observe FPRs over 1.0 % (Fig. 2, Additional file 3: Figure S5A-G). The TPR for all seven simulation scenarios with increasing noise levels decreased as the minimum mean similarity threshold was increased (Fig. 2, Additional file 3: Figure S6A-G). The final simulation, serving as the negative control, had a lower TPR rate for all similarity thresholds, as noisy clusters were never assigned edges to any other clusters (Additional file 3: Figure S5G and Figure S6G). Simulations with a random number of clusters that allowed datasets to have only one cluster tended to have a slightly lower TPR for all noise levels (Additional file 3: Figure S6D and F).
                      Fig. 2

TPR plotted against FPR for the first six CoINcIDE logged gene expression simulation scenarios for varied minimum mean similarity thresholds. The FPR is truncated at 0.02 because no FPR values ever reached above this threshold. a-f were produced using the set standard deviation random normal noise level of 0.8 (Additional file 3: Figure S5A-G plot in detail each simulation scenario at more noise levels.) a The results for the high quality simulation scenario with an equal cluster size and equal number of clusters, (b) results for the random cluster size and equal number of clusters, (c) results for the equal cluster size and random number of clusters with a minimum of two clusters per dataset, (d) results for the equal cluster size and random number of clusters with a minimum of one cluster per dataset, (e) results for the random cluster size and random number of clusters per dataset with a minimum of two clusters per dataset, and (f) results for the random cluster size and random number of clusters per dataset with a minimum of one cluster per dataset scenario. The seventh simulation is not shown here due to space constraints but plots for this simulation scenario for equal cluster size but 50 % random/noisy clusters can be found in Additional file 3: Figures S5G and S6G
                      , Next, for our first breast cancer analysis, we used the supervised PAM50 centroid classifier that defines five breast cancer subtypes using 50 genes [24] to derive highly distinct, clear clusters. We defined each group of patients assigned to a specific PAM50 subtype within a dataset as a cluster. CoINcIDE correctly re-discovered all five PAM50 subtypes, with all patients in the network assigned to their true PAM50 subtype (Fig. 3a). These CoINcIDE meta-clusters were not affected by small variations in the similarity threshold level used; for example, while the threshold used was 0.15 for this CoINcIDE analysis based off of the similarity density curve (Additional file 3: Figure S3A), applying a threshold of 0.3 to both this PAM50 feature set breast cancer analysis and the subsequent de novo PAM50 clustering analysis described below did not change any of the final meta-cluster results.

                      , The corresponding PAM50 centroid CoINcIDE network shows the relationships between the five meta-clusters (Fig. 3b, Additional file 3: Figure S7); except for one cluster, the Basal meta-cluster which is highly separated from all other meta-clusters. Clusters from one dataset (dataset 17 in Table 1) had no edges that passed the CoINcIDE thresholds for the PAM50 centroid classifier analysis, and thus were not present in the final network (Additional file 3: Figure S7). This same pattern was observed for all of the breast de novo clustering analyses described in later sections. Clusters from the three two-channel microarray datasets (datasets 1, 12, and 13 in Additional file 3: Figure S7) tended to be more weakly connected than clusters from the other datasets, which were all one-channel microarrays (Table 1)., In logistic regression models combining treatment status variables and PAM50 centroid CoINcIDE meta-cluster assignments for each patient, the AUCs for predicting binary pathological complete response (pCR), relapse-free survival (RFS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were 0.762, 0.627, and 0.609, respectively (Additional file 1: Table S8, Fig. 4a-c). Adding the meta-cluster assignments in addition to baseline treatment status models was significant (P value <2.2E-16, 2.24E-05, and 1.51E-03; see Additional file 1: Table S8 and Additional file 2: Supplementary Methods for details).

                      , Next, we used CoINcIDE to find de novo clusters in the breast cancer cohort using the PAM50 gene set. CoINcIDE discovered five subtypes (Fig. 5a); one was a Luminal A/Luminal B mixture, one was predominantly Luminal A, one was a HER2/Luminal B mixture, and two were predominantly Basal. The second Basal meta-cluster contained only three datasets (Additional file 3: Figure S8). The AUCs for treatment status plus meta-cluster assignment were 0.762, 0.657, and 0.620 for predicting pCR, RFS, and DFS, respectively (Fig. 4d-f); the corresponding P values for adding meta-cluster assignments to baseline treatment status were <2.2E-16, 4.40E-09, and 1.04E-03 (Additional file 1: Table S8). In the final network, several edges crossed between the Luminal A and Luminal A/B meta-clusters (Fig. 5b).

Node size is scaled to the relative number of samples in each cluster
                      , Next, we compared CoINcIDE to concatenating all 17 datasets using only an intersecting 35-gene PAM50 feature set, as concatenation requires an intersection, as opposed to a union, feature set (see Methods for details and Additional file 1: Table S1 for the intersection gene set). CoINcIDE discovered meta-clusters of similar make-up to the PAM50 de novo analysis reported above, but it did not discover a HER2 meta-cluster and instead of 2 Basal meta-clusters, it discovered 2 Luminal A meta-clusters (Additional file 3: Figure S9A-B). Concatenated clustering with no between-dataset transformation, which acted as a baseline concatenation model, discovered three subtypes (clusters); these clusters were highly heterogeneous in terms of PAM50 subtype signal (Fig. 6b). Concatenated clustering with gene-wise batch mean centering (BMC) discovered 2 subtypes, one predominantly Basal and one mixed Luminal A, B, and HER2 (Fig. 6c). Concatenated clustering with ComBat discovered three subtypes, one predominantly Basal, one predominantly Luminal A, and one mixed Luminal B/HER2 (Fig. 6d). The AUC values for predicting pCR, RFS, and DFS each of these concatenated clusterings were all fairly similar and ranged from 0.583 to 0.606 (Additional file 1: Table S8 and Additional file 3: Figure S10D-H). The status of each patientâs PAM50 subtype status was also calculated after each transformation for comparison; patient PAM50 subtype status was heavily altered by the between-dataset transformation methods; BMC altered the PAM50 subtype classification of 821 patients and ComBat altered the classification of 673 patients when compared to the baseline PAM50 classifications (Additional file 3: Figure S11A-B). When the ComBat and BMC classification versions were directly compared, 848 patientsâ classifications differed. We also analyzed whether a transformation like BMC would alter CoINcIDE results. When BMC was applied to each breast cancer dataset before running CoINcIDE using the full PAM50 gene set, CoINcIDE discovered a similar number of original input clusters (45) and final clusters in the CoINcIDE network (37) as the full CoINcIDE PAM50 analysis without BMC (44 and 38, respectively). CoINcIDE discovered six subtypes that were similar in PAM50 status make-up to the non-BMC CoINcIDE analysis but with two as opposed to one predominantly Luminal A subtype (Additional file 3: Figures S12 and 5B.) The predictive AUC values for pCR, RFS and DFS were 0.762, 0.660, and 0.630, respectively (see Additional file 1: Table S8 for details).
                      Fig. 6
                        CoINcIDE versus concatenated results. Bar plots summarizing the counts for each PAM50 centroid subtype for each subtyping result from (a) PAM50 restricted 35-gene set CoINcIDE k-mean clustering, (b) concatenated matrix with no transformation, (c) concatenated matrix with gene-wise batch mean centering (BMC), and (d) concatenated matrix with ComBat. All analyses used k-means consensus clustering using the Proportion of Ambiguous Clusters (PAC) to select the number of clusters. These bar plots used only the 35-gene set to assign patients to PAM50 centroid subtypes (Additional file 1: Table S1). PAM50 centroid assignments were made on the pre-transformed concatenated datasets to allow for direct comparison between all four subtype discovery methods. See Additional file 3: Figure S9B for the corresponding CoINcIDE network figure for (a)
                      , We then investigated whether the CoINcIDE de novo PAM50 analyses produced subtypes with similar prognostic significance as subtypes derived in a supervised manner using the PAM50 centroid classifications directly as patient subtypes (see Supplemental Methods in Additional file 2 for details). Transforming the datasets using BMC or ComBat before the supervised centroid analysis did not improve prognostic performance, and in some cases the performance decreased after these transformations (see Additional file 3: Figure S10I-Q and Additional file 1: Table S8 for details). CoINcIDE, using either the intersecting or full PAM50 gene set to derive de novo clusters for each dataset, performed comparably or better in terms of AUC compared to these supervised analyses (Additional file 1: Table S8)., Finally, as our last evaluation of CoINcIDE using the curated breast datasets, we ran de novo clustering analyses using meta-ranked gene sets based on gene expression variance without using PAM 50 genes (see Methods for details.) We derived gene sets of 50, 264, and 2,020 genes. All three non-PAM50 de novo CoINcIDE analyses produced subtypes with similar patient make-up as the PAM50 de novo CoINcIDE analysis (Additional file 3: Figure S13A, C, and E). All three of the non-PAM50 analyses were more predictive of outcomes than any of the concatenated clustering analyses (Additional file 1: Table S8); in particular, the non-PAM50 264-gene set CoINcIDE analysis produced subtypes with an AUC of 0.757 when combined with treatment status to predict pCR (Additional file 1: Table S8, Additional file 3: Figure S10U). This result is comparable to those of both the semi-supervised PAM50 centroid classification and de novo PAM50 CoINcIDE analyses and better than the models produced by the supervised PAM50 analyses (Additional file 1: Table S8)., Next, we used CoINcIDE on the ovarian cancer datasets to discover novel subtypes using de novo meta-ranked gene sets in the same manner as the non-PAM50 CoINcIDE analyses (see Methods for details.) Two gene lists, one small (that is, 200 meta-ranked genesâ+â40 additional non-intersecting intra-rank genes) and one large (that is, 2,000 meta-ranked genesâ+â14 intra-ranked genes) were used, resulting in two CoINcIDE de novo clustering analyses (Additional file 1: Tables S6 and S7, respectively). These analyses incorporated 24 datasets from the curatedOvarianData collection [17]., Using the ovarian cancer 240-gene de novo clusters as inputs, CoINcIDE discovered three meta-clusters, or subtypes (Fig. 7a-b); subtypes 1 and 2 contained predominantly patient tumor samples with serous histology and subtype 3 contained mixed tumor histologies (Additional file 3: Figure S14A). From the TCGA dataset, two of the serous clusters were assigned to the two different serous subtypes, while the third serous cluster was not assigned any edges and thus was not included in the final network (Additional file 3: Figure S15A).

The symbols along the survival curves represent actual patient dataset points. A minimum mean similarity metric threshold of 0.5 was used to derive the long gene list results (Additional file 3: Figures S17 and S18 show results using a threshold of 0.7). Nâ=ânumber of events used in the model
                      , An effect size analysis was run on the dataset clusters assigned to each CoINcIDE subtype to identify marker genes for each subtype. A GSEA analysis using genes with an effect size of at least 0.5 for each subtype revealed distinctive signaling patterns; subtype 1 was enriched in gene sets for immune signaling, subtype 2 was enriched in gene sets for classic oncogenes such as PTEN, P53, and KRAS and cell development, and subtype 3 was enrichments in gene sets for VEGF and RAF pathways. Each subtype contained distinct potential drug target genes as defined by the Druggable Genome [31] with an effect size greater than 0.75 (Additional file 1: Tables S9 and S10). These subtypes significantly stratified patients both by overall survival and survival with a 5-year cutoff (Fig. 7b) (P values of 0.0479 and 0.0118, respectively). The mixed histology subtype contained sparse outcomes data and had the worst outcome (Fig. 7b)., Using the larger 2,014-gene set, CoINcIDE discovered six subtypes (Fig. 7c-d); subtypes 1 to 3 contained predominantly patient tumor samples with serous histology, subtypes 4 and 5 contained mixed histologies, and subtype 6 contained predominantly mucinous tissue samples; the three serous subtypes contained the majority of the patients in the network (Additional file 3: Figure S14B). One of the 24 input datasets was not used because it did not contain 80 % of these 2,014 meta-ranked genes, leaving 23 datasets for analysis (Additional file 3: Figure S15B)., We again used an effect size analysis to identify marker genes for each subtype and analyzed them using GSEA. This analysis revealed that subtype 1 was enriched in gene lists for immune signaling and Huntingtonâs and Parkinsonâs disease, subtype 2 was enriched in gene lists for DNA repair and cell cycle signaling, subtype 3 was enriched in gene lists for classic oncogenes such as Notch and mTOR signaling, subtype 4 was enriched in gene lists for metabolism signaling, subtype 5 was enriched in gene sets for HIV/immune signaling, and subtype 6 was enriched in gene lists for apoptosis. Each subtype contained distinct potential drug target genes as defined by the Druggable Genome [31] with an effect size greater than 0.75 (Additional file 1: Tables S11 and S12)., These six ovarian cancer subtypes significantly stratified patients both by overall survival and survival with a 5-year cutoff (P values of 6.84E-06 and 8.16E-06, respectively). Because the non-serous subtypes contain sparse outcomes data, we cannot make strong inferences about the clinical utility of these subtypes, and thus we will focus our discussion on the three serous subtypes. The 5-year Kaplan Meier survival curve shows a distinct survival stratification between the serous immune and the serous DNA repair and oncogene subtypes (meta-clusters 1 versus 2 and 3, Fig. 7d). A similar analysis with only the three serous subtypes was also highly significant (figure not shown; P value of 7.93E-06). Meta-clusters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 contained 735, 200, 33, 32, and 789 patients, respectively; meta-cluster 6 contained only eight patients with outcomes data. When we removed meta-cluster 6 from the overall survival and survival analyses, the remaining five meta-clusters still significantly stratified patients (P values of 2.22E-06 and 2.97E-06, respectively)., To compare the prognostic significance of the full set of six CoINcIDE subtypes against that of standard clinical variables, we also ran univariate Cox proportional hazards models using histological type, tumor grade, and tumor stage. Histological type and tumor grade were weakly prognostic for overall survival (P values of 4.00E-02 and 3.26E-03, respectively) and with a 5-year cutoff (P values of 1.00E-01 and 1.30E-02, respectively). Tumor stage significantly stratified patients by both overall survival and with a 5-year cutoff (P values of 8.80E-12 and 1.35E-09, respectively). The CoINcIDE subtypes were not strongly defined by tumor stage (Additional file 3: Figure S16), suggesting that CoINcIDE captures novel clinically relevant signal., When the second global density curve maxima similarity threshold of 0.7 (Additional file 3: Figure S3D) was used, CoINcIDE discovered seven subtypes; 5/7 of these subtypes had greater than three datasets and closely mirrored the subtypes found in the 0.5 threshold analysis, including the three large serous clusters (Additional file 3: Figure S17A-B). These subtypes significantly predicted overall and 5-year cutoff continuous outcomes (Additional file 3: Figure S18) with P values of 2.52E-04 and 3.46E-04, respectively. Several of these meta-clusters (meta-clusters 5, 6, and 7) had less than 30 outcomes recorded; if these clusters are removed, the overall and 5-year cutoff survival P values were higher, but still significant at 6.63E-03 and 2.81E-03, respectively., We further confirmed the stability of the three serous meta-clusters from the large gene list CoINcIDE analysis (using the initial 0.5 similarity threshold) by removing the TCGA dataset and re-running CoINcIDE. Removing this large, high-quality dataset did not change any of the other dataset clustersâ final assignments in the three serous subtypes (Additional file 3: Figure S19A-B); the assignments for the three non-serous subtypes also did not change because none of these contained clusters from the TCGA dataset. These CoINcIDE subtypes without the TCGA dataset still significantly stratified patients by overall survival and with a 5-year cutoff (P values of 1.05E-04 and 3.67E-05, respectively)., We present here CoINcIDE, a framework for discovery of patient subtypes across multiple datasets. The simulated tissue cluster data results show that CoINcIDE performs well with reasonable noise levels, clusters with differing sample sizes, and datasets with differing numbers of clusters. The TPR slightly decreased for simulations that allowed datasets to have a single cluster, in part because CoINcIDE does not allow for the comparison of clusters that are both derived from datasets with only one cluster. CoINcIDE is conservative in that it maintains a low FPR even as noise levels increase; even when the minimum mean similarity threshold was set to 0.0, the FPR rate never increased above 10 %. CoINcIDE also does not assign edges between low-quality, noisy clusters, as seen in the final simulation where 50 % of the clusters were samples randomly selected from all tissue types (Additional file 3: Figures S5G and S6G). These results give us confidence that CoINcIDE can identify true subtypes in scenarios that mimic real-life datasets with varying noise levels, numbers of clusters, and sizes of clusters., The CoINcIDE PAM50 centroid cluster breast cancer analysis re-discovered the PAM50 subtypes, confirming CoINcIDEâs accuracy on a large database of real gene expression datasets. We acknowledge that completely accurate PAM50 subtypes can only be achieved using the commercially available platform, nor are the PAM50 subtypes a ground truth, but simply a set of subtypes known to be replicable [32]. However, using the PAM50 centroids to assign patients to PAM50 subtypes, we have illustrated that CoINcIDE accurately captures known clinically relevant subtypes. Additionally, the pCR, or treatment response, AUC of 0.762 closely matches the reported AUC of 0.78 from the initial PAM50 publication [3], showing that CoINcIDE also produces meta-clusters with expected correlative patterns to an external response variable., The CoINcIDE breast cancer networks discovered also reflect known hormonal signaling patterns in breast cancer; for example, the full PAM50 set de novo clustering Basal meta-cluster was highly separately from the other meta-clusters, and contained tightly interconnected clusters (Fig. 3a). This trend was also seen throughout the non-PAM50 gene set analyses (Additional file 3: Figures S11A, C, and E). Basal breast tumors are considered to be fairly distinct from other tumor subtypes, in terms of treatment response, gene expression, and mutation patterns [33]. Clusters of various sizes and hormonal status, from various microarray platforms with various mixtures of subtypes, were included in the final breast cancer networks, highlighting CoINcIDEâs ability to overcome dataset-specific noise without any additional dataset transformations beyond baseline intra-dataset normalization., The CoINcIDE meta-cluster network visualizations are an intuitive data exploration tool to help researchers identify such potential biases. For example, although it did not heavily affect the final overall meta-clusters, the two-channel dataset clusters in the breast analyses had far fewer edges assigned to other clusters than the one-channel dataset clusters (this platform bias was not observed in the ovarian cancer networks.) It is also easy to identify a highly replicable, robust subtype as a meta-cluster with many nodes (clusters) tightly connected by many edges with very few edges spanning across to other meta-clusters., The PAM50 gene set de novo cluster CoINcIDE analysis using k-means consensus clustering showed that CoINcIDE can discover biologically intuitive signal when each dataset is de novo clustered in an automatic, unbiased fashion. A consistent pattern seen in all breast cancer analyses was that the CoINcIDE subtypes discovered tended to be more significantly prognostic (that is, lower P values) in outcomes models for treatment response (pCR) than long-term outcomes (RFS or DFS); in fact, the de novo clustering analysis achieved the same pCR AUC as the PAM50 centroid clustering pCR AUC (Additional file 1: Table S8)., The concatenated dataset analyses show how transformation techniques to remove dataset-specific artifacts can significantly alter actual biological signal found in a dataset. This emphasizes the importance of methods like CoINcIDE that require no between-dataset normalization, especially when researchers are searching for finer-grained subtypes whose assignments may change heavily with any transformations. However, while applying no transformation, BMC or ComBat resulted in highly different concatenated clustering results (Fig. 6), applying BMC to each individual dataset did not heavily alter CoINcIDEâs results, suggesting that CoINcIDE is also reasonably robust to different normalization procedures. CoINcIDE also discovered either clearer subtypes in terms of known PAM50 signal and/or presented more finer-grained subtypes for greater exploratory analyses in comparison to the concatenated analyses. CoINcIDE also identified a potential outlier (or highly distinct) dataset whose clusters were never assigned edges to any clusters in other datasets for any gene set tested. This dataset did not fall out as a separate cluster in any of the concatenated clusterings, but rather was smoothed over the different subtypes., Similar AUC results as those from the PAM50 de novo CoINcIDE analysis were achieved when using de novo meta-ranked gene sets that did not include the PAM50 gene set; these results outperformed all of the concatenated clustering results, regardless of whether BMC or ComBat was applied (Additional file 1: Table S8). These prognostic results using CoINcIDE also performed comparably, and oftentimes better, than a completely supervised approach using the PAM50 centroid classifications, with or without transforming the data a priori using BMC or ComBat (Additional file 1: Table S8). We acknowledge that these results do not reflect the accuracy or usefulness of the commercial PAM50 platform performed in a controlled laboratory setting; rather, they show that CoINcIDE can produce subtypes with similar prognostic significance than those derived from much more controlled supervised methods. It also appears that for supervised analyses, transformations such as BMC or ComBat have negligible effects in terms of producing subtypes that can accurately predict outcomes (when combined with treatment information), but these transformations have much stronger negative effects when unsupervised cluster analyses are used to derive the subtypes. However, the latter approach is oftentimes needed when a researcher or clinician is not aware a priori of the key patient subtypes in a disease., An additional benefit to CoINcIDE over concatenated dataset analyses includes shorter analysis run-times; k-means clustering on a large concatenated dataset can be computationally intensive. Finally, CoINcIDE also provides metrics to interpret the replicability and quality for each specific subtype. The CoINcIDE R package reports the number of datasets with clusters assigned to each subtype that passed significance and similarity thresholds, and how many edges for that subtype were assigned to clusters within the same subtypes. A user can easily interpret not only these quantitative metrics, but also the resulting network visualizations. The CoINcIDE package includes between-dataset normalization methods like ComBat so that they can be compared alongside a CoINcIDE analysis., The ovarian analyses showed that CoINcIDE can provide important biological insight into a disease for which clear gene expression subtypes have proven elusive [34]; this ambiguity in signal is manifested in the CoINcIDE networks for both the short and long gene list analyses that have several edges spanning different meta-clusters (Fig. 7a and c). However, the effect size analyses on each CoINcIDE meta-cluster provide biological hypotheses for which genes may be the most robust in differentiating ovarian subtypes, in particular the serous subtypes. For example, in the short-gene list CoINcIDE ovarian analysis, the Druggable Genome [31] gene CYP4B1 had the highest effect size (0.676, Additional file 1: Table S9) in the serous meta-cluster 1. The expression of this gene has been confirmed stratify non-platinum-resistant serous ovarian cancer patients that do not and do have recurrences after a taxane regimen [35]. While this effect size is relatively modest, it is a robust measurement across several datasets, and suggests that CYP4B1 may provide insights into therapy for ovarian cancer patients tailored by subtype. In the long-gene list CoINcIDE ovarian subtypes, CYP4B1 had an even higher effect size (0.853, Additional file 1: Table S11) for the serous meta-cluster 1, further highlighting its potential use as a druggable target., The other two serous meta-clusters from the long-gene list analysis, meta-clusters 2 and 5, had poorer outcomes in general (Fig. 7d). CoINcIDE also identified potential druggable targets within each of these meta-clusters, such as the gene ODC1 which has an effect size of 1.092 in meta-cluster 2 (Additional file 1: Table S11) There is not extensive literature on ODC1 in serous ovarian cancer, but it has been suggested that this geneâs expression decreases when platinum is added to ovarian cancer cell lines [36], suggesting ODC1 may indeed have therapeutic relevance for meta-cluster 2. Beyond providing druggable hypotheses, these CoINcIDE subtypes (meta-clusters) driven by these effect size patterns also significantly stratify patients by length of survival (Fig. 7d), giving us further confidence in their clinical utility., CoINcIDE also highlighted the shortcomings of using only a single dataset such as the TCGA dataset to cluster tissue samples. For example, we observed two persistent serous subtypes across both the small and large gene list ovarian analyses; the long gene list analysis produced a third serous subtype that incorporated the third TCGA serous cluster not included in the short gene list CoINcIDE network. This third subtype contained far fewer clusters and less edges interconnecting the clusters, suggesting that this third meta-cluster should be viewed as more exploratory, or that the gene set used does not capture the signal in this meta-cluster as clearly as in the two other serous meta-clusters., The initial TCGA ovarian publication reported four serous subtypes: âimmunoreactiveâ, âproliferativeâ, âmesenchymalâ, and âdifferentiationâ [37]; the three serous meta-clusters discovered by the CoINcIDE long-gene list analysis follow roughly similar trends in that one was enriched in immune response, one in DNA repair and one in classical oncogene signaling. Recent TCGA analyses on the Broad Instituteâs GDAC website [38] that used non-negative matrix factorization and hierarchical consensus clustering suggest that there are three, as opposed to four, stable serous ovarian meta-clusters, the same number we discovered in our long-gene set analysis (see the caption of Additional file 3: Figure S20 for data details.) The CoINcIDE serous ovarian meta-cluster patient assignments roughly correspond to these recent GDAC webserver patient assignments, but they are not identical (Additional file 3: Figure S20). The differences in the number of clusters and enrichment patterns between the initial TCGA published subtypes, the GDAC webserver results and the CoINcIDE subtypes reflect a broader, continued debate on the number and replicability of ovarian serous subtypes. A recent report suggests that serous ovarian cancer subtypes are a âholy grailâ [34]. We acknowledge that further work, especially in vivo cell line tests, must be done to validate the ovarian subtypes we have discovered using CoINcIDE, but their prognostic significance across multiple datasets provides a robust platform from which to validate them further., More importantly, the TCGA ovarian publication stated that the reported four expression subtypes did not significantly stratify TCGA patients by survival duration [37], while the CoINcIDE subtypes for both the small and large gene list analyses significantly stratified patients by overall survival, not just for the TCGA dataset, but across several datasets. Outcomes data were sparse for the mixed histology subtypes, and thus broad survival trends for these subtypes cannot be readily inferred, but the CoINcIDE analysis still provided robust effect sizes of genes that distinguish these subtypes from the serous subtypes. A stand-alone TCGA analysis would not have provided this information, because it would have only contained samples with serous histology., Additionally, we showed that the CoINcIDE subtypes remained the same upon removal of the TCGA dataset, emphasizing that multiple smaller datasets can provide stable CoINcIDE subtypes. The success of CoINcIDE in finding subtypes that are both biologically intuitive and predictive of survival is of course dependent upon the input feature (gene set) and the single-dataset clustering algorithm, but it is an effective framework to confirm that the resulting subtypes are highly replicable across numerous datasets and thus stand a chance of being implemented one day in routine clinical practice., In the era of big data, multiple datasets have now been collected for a single disease, necessitating meta-analysis cluster frameworks. CoINcIDE harnesses the power of multiple datasets to provide novel approaches for unsupervised clustering across multiple datasets. CoINcIDE has the ability to discover both replicable and prognostically significant subtypes without any additional dataset-specific transformations, unlike the current established method of concatenation. CoINcIDE also does not require a strictly intersecting feature set across all datasets, and the final meta-cluster network provides a rich platform to infer both potential meta-cluster and dataset-specific trends., Finally, the framework proposed here is not limited to gene expression data; CoINcIDE can be implemented using various clustering algorithms, and even distance, as opposed to similarity, metrics. The CoINcIDE framework and the breast cancer collection are available as R packages to the community; it is our hope that these resources and methods provide a platform for further development of novel methods to cluster across multiple datasets., Both curatedBreastData and CoINcIDE are available as R packages.

                Background
                Limited treatment options are available for patients infected with multidrug (MDR)- or pan-drug (PDR)-resistant bacterial pathogens, resulting in infections that can persist for weeks or months. In order to better understand transmission and evolutionary dynamics of MDR Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) during long-term infection, we analyzed genomes from a series of isolates from individual patients at isolate-specific, patient-specific, and population levels.
              
                Methods
                Whole genome analysis of longitudinal isolates (range 2-10 isolates per patient spanning 0-829 days) from 40 patients included detection of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion sequence (IS) mapping, and gene content changes.
              
                Results
                Phylogenetic analysis revealed that a significant fraction of apparently persistent infections are in fact due to re-infection with new strains. SNVs primarily resulted in protein coding changes, and IS events primarily interrupted genes or were in an orientation such that the adjacent gene would be over-expressed. Mutations acquired during infection were over-represented in transcriptional regulators, notably pmrAB and adeRS, which can mediate resistance to the last line therapies colistin and tigecycline, respectively, as well as transporters, surface structures, and iron acquisition genes.
              
                Conclusions
                Most SNVs and IS events were isolate-specific indicating these mutations did not become fixed on the time scale investigated, yet over-representation of independent mutations in some genes or functional categories suggests that they are under selective pressure. Genome analysis at the population-level suggests that gene transfer including recombination also contributes to Ab evolutionary dynamics. These findings provide important insight into the transmission dynamics of Ab and the identification of patients with repeat infections has implications for infection control programs targeted to this pathogen.

Genome analysis at the population-level suggests that gene transfer including recombination also contributes to Ab evolutionary dynamics. These findings provide important insight into the transmission dynamics of Ab and the identification of patients with repeat infections has implications for infection control programs targeted to this pathogen., Bacterial pathogens resistant to multiple classes of antibiotics are increasingly detected in clinical settings, and patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections have limited treatment options. This occurrence can translate into prolonged infections with increased morbidity and mortality [1, 2]. Analysis of MDR strains isolated over time from individual patients during infection and treatment can reveal important adaptations to the host environment [3â5]. The most extensive work to date has characterized longitudinal genome changes in cystic fibrosis patients infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia species, where these studies found that mutations were enriched in genes related to host adaptation and antibiotic resistance, and observed the co-existence of multiple lineages in the same host [6â10]. Patients with cystic fibrosis experience long-term infections, often spanning many years. Fewer studies have examined genomic changes in the context of acute infections that persevere during hospitalization, nor have longitudinal genomic changes within the context of a broader population structure been assessed., In the last decade, Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab), one of the ESKAPE pathogens, emerged to become a predominant cause of nosocomial infections [11â14]. This is in part due to a remarkable rise in the frequency of MDR (resistant to at least three classes of antibiotic) and extreme drug resistant (XDR; resistant to all antibiotics except tigecycline or colistin) infections [12â14]. Notably, infections with carbapenem-resistant MDR and XDR strains are associated with longer hospitalization, greater economic costs, and higher mortality vs. carbapenem-susceptible strains [15â23]., Increased antibiotic resistance in Ab has been primarily driven by acquisition of resistance determinants encoded on mobile genetic elements and activation of intrinsic resistance mechanisms such as the chromosomal Î²-lactamases, bla
                        OXA-51-like and bla
                        ADC, and increased activity of efflux pumps such as adeABC [24, 25]. A large âresistance islandâ encoding more than a dozen antibiotic resistance genes was found in one of the first MDR Ab strains to be sequenced [26], and sequencing of hundreds of additional strains has shown that resistance genes are often associated with plasmids [27, 28]. The ISAba1 element and other insertion sequences have also contributed to antibiotic resistance by activating expression of intrinsic resistance genes adjacent to their insertion sites [29]. ISAba1 elements are abundant in some Ab strains, and the location of ISAba1 insertions can add resolution to population dynamics and genomic epidemiology [30], but the role of these elements in adaptation to selective pressures during infections has not been addressed., Clinicians have observed that in treating Ab infections, some patients remain chronically infected for prolonged periods of time. Whether long-term infected patients are the result of the persistence of one strain due to treatment failure, or new infection by a different strain, remains a pressing question. Genome sequencing provides an opportunity to address this question. We previously characterized the genetic profiles of Ab strains isolated from a large hospital system in the Midwestern USA and found considerable diversity including evidence for multiple closely related lineages and extensive variability of mobile elements [30]. In this follow-up study, we sought to understand what genome changes occur during the course of infection and antibiotic treatment. We therefore decided to sequence all available strains from patients that had multiple positive Ab cultures to characterize the nature of genetic change during infections. Longitudinal analysis of isolates collected during the course of infection and treatment can provide insight into infection history, and how Ab responds to host and antibiotic selective pressures., 
                           A. baumannii strains identified in the University Hospitals Health System (UHHS) Clinical Microbiology Laboratory were stored in an archive since 2007. We identified all patients for which there were more than two isolates available in the archive as of 1 December 2013, and those isolates were selected for whole genome sequencing. A total of 136 new strains were sequenced and these genomes were combined for analysis with previously described sequences from UHHS [30] for a high resolution population-level analysis. Repeat cultures were ordered when patients presented with continued signs of infections. Clinical data, including treatment history and outcome, were collected from patient charts. The research study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Hospitals Case Medical Center, and conformed to the Helsinki Declaration., Overnight cultures were grown in LB broth and DNA was isolated using an UltraCleanÂ® Microbial DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio, Inc.) using a protocol implemented on an Eppendorf EpMotion automated pipetting device. Libraries were prepared for sequencing using Illumina NexteraXT kits and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 with paired 100-base sequence reads. In general, more than 100-fold coverage was obtained for each genome. Each read set was assembled individually using velvet [31] and annotated using NCBIâs PGAAP pipeline (http://âwww.âncbi.ânlm.ânih.âgov/âgenome/âannotation_âprok/â). All genomes are available at NCBI under BioProject PRJNA262565., A core phylogeny based on single nucleotide variants (SNVs) was inferred using SNVs identified by kSNP [32] and constructed using RAxML [33] with previously sequenced UHHS and other publicly available genomes included for phylogenetic context [30]. Genome positions with allele calls in at least 80 % of strains were included in the analysis. Regions of the genome subject to recombination were excluded from consideration in construction of the core phylogeny as in Wright et al. [30]., A more stringent approach was used to identify patient-restricted and isolate-specific SNVs from all patients with monophyletic isolates. Primary Illumina sequence reads were aligned to patient-specific reference genome assemblies, typically the earliest isolate from each patient, using bwa. To avoid the impact of low-quality sequences at contig edges, SNVs within 200 bases of contig edges were excluded. Variant-calling was performed using freebayes (arXiv:1207.3907 [q-bio.GN]) with a requirement for â¥20-fold coverage of the alternative allele with no reads supporting the reference allele, and a minimum SNV quality of 500. SNVs identified when reads from the reference genome were aligned to the reference contigs were excluded as likely indicating errors in the reference assembly. Patient-specific SNVs were identified as those SNVs uniquely shared within a patient based on the kSNP output for the full set of SNVs annotated to the reference Ab ACICU genome. ACICU was the first sequenced MLST ST2 (Global Clone 2) isolate, obtained from Italy in 2005 [34], and was selected as a reference because the majority of isolates in this study are GC2. Synonymous/non-synonymous status was inferred based on alignment of flanking sequences to the ACICU annotation., To identify gene gain and loss events during infection, pan-genome analysis was performed using PanOCT [35]. The locations of IS elements in the draft genome assemblies was performed using ISSeeker, a custom perl script (https://âgithub.âcom/âJCVI-VIRIFX/âISseeker). IS locations in each genome were mapped to the common reference genome ACICU. The two most abundant IS elements in this population, ISAba1 and IS26 were examined and isolate-specific and patient-specific insertion sites were determined and mapped to the ACICU annotation., Functional roles and pathways were assigned using KEGG designations [36] and TIGRfams [37] for each non-synonymous SNV and non-neutral IS event, and the number of genes within each category was determined for ACICU. To identify statistically significant enrichment in functional classes of genes, hypergeometric probability tests were conducted. In the calculation, the population size was the number of all genes in the PanOCT shared clusters for the 136 genomes (553,343 genes); the population successes value was calculated as the number of genes in each functional role or pathway category based on its abundance in ACICU multiplied by each genesâ occurrence in the PanOCT shared clusters; sample size was the number of SNV or IS events for isolate-specific (IS), patient-restricted (PR), or patient-specific (PS) categories, respectively; and the number of sample successes was the number of hit genes in each category., Genome sequences were obtained for 136 Ab isolates from 40 patients (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2: Table S2). The number of isolates per patient was in the range of 2-10, over 0-829 days between first and last isolation (Additional file 1: Table S1). The pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility indicated that 125/136 isolates were resistant to â¥3 classes of antibiotics and are thus considered MDR. Isolates were collected from an integrated healthcare system: a central referral hospital (92/136), outlying community hospitals that were part of the healthcare system (23/136), long-term care facilities (16/136), and outpatient clinics (5/136). The isolates were collected from patients evaluated in an ICU, general medical wards, and from the emergency department. The 136 genomes were placed in the context of other UHHS genomes detailed in Wright et al. [30], and 22 publicly available reference genomes using a phylogeny constructed from 50,466 core SNVs located in non-recombinant regions of the genome (Fig. 1).

SNVs were identified using kSNP and the tree was built using RAxML.

                      , A patient was considered to have an infection stemming from one colonization event when all of the isolates from that patient were located on a monophyletic, well-supported terminal node of the core phylogeny. Twenty-five patients had such monophyletic infections (Fig. 2, Additional file 1: Table S1). Fifteen patients had polyphyletic infections with isolates located at clearly distinct branches of the phylogenetic tree, indicative of at least two independent colonization events. Two of these patients have co-occurring polyphyletic infections in which phylogenetically distinct strains were isolated in overlapping time intervals, while the other 13 polyphyletic patients were likely re-infected with new strain types. In some cases, multiple related (monophyletic) strains were isolated from patients that were also infected with genetically distinct strains (polyphyletic). There was no relationship between the number of days separating culture-positive isolations and the likelihood of whether a new isolate was closely related (monophyletic) or represented a reinfection (polyphyletic) (Additional file 1: Table S1). The site of infection also did not predict whether subsequent isolates would be related: there are examples of both monophyletic (for example, Patient 236) and polyphyletic infections (for example, Patient 348) occurring at different body sites in the same patient.

                      , SNVs in monophyletic groups from individual patients were of particular interest and were examined in more detail. Three classes of SNVs were defined: isolate-specific (IS) SNVs were found only in a single isolate; patient-restricted (PR) SNVs were found in multiple isolates (but not all) from a single patient; and patient-specific (PS) SNVs were shared by all isolates from a patient. For all three classes, the SNVs were not observed in any other UHHS or public reference strain. The complete list of these SNVs with gene annotations is presented in Additional file 3: Table S3. Most of the SNVs that occurred during infection were unique to each isolate: of the 220 detected SNVs, 189 (86 %) were isolate-specific. IS SNVs arising during infection were detected in 31 strains (mean 4.8 SNVs, range 0-29 SNVs/patient). PR SNVs were identified in nine patients (range: 0-8 SNVs/patient). There was no relationship between the number of SNVs per isolate and the number of days between isolations (Fig. 3). For example, the three isolates from Patient 236 collected on the same day had eight SNVs among them, while three isolates from Patient 195 over 48 days had 0 detected SNVs among them. Isolates from distinct body sites did have more isolate-specific SNVs. For example, the two Clade B isolates from Patient 184 had 14 (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy site) and 15 (urinary tract infection) IS SNVs. SNVs that were restricted to a patient had a higher proportion of non-synonymous (NS) amino acid substitutions compared to synonymous (S) substitutions (NS/(NSâ+âS): 0.97) than the isolate-specific (0.77) and patient-specific SNVs (0.74) (Table 1) yet all categories of isolate- and patient-restricted SNVs were strongly skewed towards non-synonymous mutations relative to the population-level NS/(NSâ+âS) ratio of 0.18.

                    , ISAba1 is abundant and dynamic in the UHHS population, and mapping of the insertion sites for ISAba1 revealed additional genomic modifications during infection. Similar to SNV patterns, most new ISAba1 insertions were isolate-specific and these tended to be in coding regions or in an orientation that would result in overexpression of an adjacent gene (Table 1, Additional file 4: Table S4). Only three patient-restricted IS events were detected, two of which are predicted to result in the overexpression of downstream genes. Independent ISAba1 insertions upstream of the fimA gene in two different patients were predicted to lead to overexpression of the type-1 fimbrial protein. A smaller fraction of patient-specific IS events (uniquely shared among all isolates from a patient) were in coding sequences or an overexpression orientation, while across all UHHS isolates, ISAba1 was less likely to be found in an overexpression orientation., The 10 strains isolated from Patient 243 provide particularly illustrative examples of SNV and ISAba1 patterns associated with temporal and spatial heterogeneity. Six isolates encompassing respiratory, urine, and abdominal sites of infection had no detectible SNVs among them, including three isolates cultured 8 days after the initial sample. The other four isolates had between two and six SNVs relative to Day 0 isolates. All but one these SNVs were isolate-specific, where the mutation in the RNA polymerase gene rpoB was present in two Day 8 abdominal fluid isolates. No ISAba1 insertions that arose during infection were shared among Patient 243 isolates. SNV patterns from Patient 236, on the other hand, reveal that spatial isolation can lead to strain differentiation. The three isolates are monophyletic, forming a terminal branch with distinct SNVs and gene content from other UHHS strains. The blood and abdominal fluid isolates (ABUH23684 and ABUH23685) have three shared SNVs and one ISAba1 insertion not present in ABUH23687 (a scrotal isolate) which has two unique SNVs., Gene content changes in monophyletic isolates were primarily gene loss events centered around IS26-mediated deletions in the astA and ACICU_02399 Tn1548 resistance island regions described in [30]. IS26 has been shown to cause deletions of adjacent sequence [38, 39]. We observed a partial deletion of Tn1548 at the catB gene in ABUH315100 which resulted in the loss of the amikacin resistance gene, armA, and independent losses of the adjacent csuE region in multiple isolates as best depicted by the variable presence of csuE in isolates from clades B and D (Fig. 1). Variation in phage content was observed in Patient 410 in a region previously described as dynamic [30]. The first Patient 410 isolate had one 48 kbp region of phage sequence, the second had an additional 36 kbp of sequence, and the last two isolates had an additional 13 kbp of sequence in this region, resulting in a variable phage region in the range of 48-97 kbp in size., Two patients had co-occurring polyphyletic infections in the same infection site: bronchial specimens from Patient 367 and Patient 455 produced isolates from different clades. There was no evidence for genetic exchange between the Clade A strains in Patient 367 and the more divergent ABUH367558, which was isolated at an intermediate time point between the two clade A strains. The two clade A strains are isogenic, as they share a terminal branch on the tree, with only three SNVs that distinguish them and a uniquely shared ISAba1 insertion in a gene encoding the histidine kinase protein of an uncharacterized two component regulatory system (TCRS) (ACICU_03157). This strain persisted largely unchanged during the 77 days between isolations. Genetic exchange did occur between the two different strain types in Patient 455: pABUH1 was transferred from the clade A strain to the clade B strain (ABUH45561 to ABUH45538/ABUH45562) as previously described [30]., Thirteen patients had polyphyletic infections where re-infection or replacement with a new strain type was likely. Clade A strains carry the most resistance determinants and were not replaced with a different strain type in this population., Analysis of the functional categories of genes with SNVs and IS insertions demonstrated that genes associated with antibiotic resistance and host interaction are over-represented (Table 2). The most commonly mutated genes were pmrAB that encode the two component regulatory system (TCRS) involved in mediating colistin resistance through modification of surface polysaccharides and membrane charge [40â43]. Twelve patients had at least one isolate with a mutation in pmrA or pmrB and four of those patients had multiple strains with independent mutations (Fig. 4a). The adeRS genes, which encode a TCRS that regulates expression of the efflux pump operon adeABC, were the second most commonly mutated loci, found in isolates from 12 patients (Fig. 4b). Seven patients had mutations in both the pmrAB and adeRS TCRS genes. Another uncharacterized histidine kinase component of a TCRS, ACICU_03157, had both ISAba1 and point mutations in three patients. Transporters were also significantly enriched, accounting for 30 out of 123 non-synonymous SNVs in the isolate-specific SNV set. This included multiple cation (copA, znuB (two independent mutations) and arsB) and iron-related transporters (fhuE (two independent mutations), feoB, and siderophore transporters), as wells as antibiotic transporters including the porin carO, adeB, and adeJ efflux pumps, and those associated with lipopolysaccharide export, msbA and lptF. The iron acquisition gene, iucD, had both NS SNV and IS mutations in strains from four patients (Fig. 3c). Motility and adhesion related genes were also significantly enriched (for example, csuE, pilG, and fimA). Mutations in the tyrosine kinase wcz gene involved in capsular polysaccharide assembly were detected in three patients, while UDP-N-acetylmuramate-alanine ligase murD mutations were observed twice. The RNA polymerase III gene, rpoB, had three NS mutations in two patients; all of the SNVs were located in the rifampin resistance-determining region (RRDR).Table 2

                        Selected loci with multiple independent mutations. Genes and gene regions that exhibited a significantly over-representation of mutation frequency are shown. a The pmrCAB genes encode the PmrAB TCRS that is associated with resistance to colistin and one of the target genes (pmrC), that encodes a lipid A phosphoethanolamine transferase. b The adeABC genes encode an RND family efflux pump that is involved in resistance to several classes of antibiotics. The adeRS genes encode a TCRS that regulates adeABC. c A region encoding several genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis. Iron acquisition mediated by siderophores is an important adaptive mechanism in the host environment that is characterized by limited free iron concentrations
                      , ISAba1 insertion sites also tended to be in genes with functions in antibiotic resistance and host adaptation. Genes encoding transporters (including AdeABC efflux pump), transcriptional regulators, surface-associated genes, and secreted and adhesion genes like papD and fimA, were all modified by ISAba1 (Additional file 4: Table S4)., The primary clade structure described previously is unchanged with the addition of the strains analyzed here [30, 44]. Clade A is most abundant, with 58 isolates. The analysis of the expanded set of UHHS strains revealed that there are two clade A subgroups that differ in the presence of a region that encodes a heme oxygenase, hemO, (Fig. 1) that was previously described as a recombination hotspot [30, 45, 46]. There is evidence for more divergent strains among the most recent isolates that carry new genetic material, including the bla
                           OXA-72 variant of the bla
                           OXA24/40-type carbapenemase gene in ABUH588656 and ABUH588663. There is now evidence for recombination at the bla
                           OXA-51 locus in clade C, with a different allele now present., Epidemiological and genomic data highlight multiple cases of likely patient-to-patient transmission. For example, the clade A cluster of isolates from Patients 243, 315, and 487 all occurred in the ICU within the span of a few days in 2007. These three patients share four unique SNVs, while Patients 243 and 487 share an ISAba1 event. Similarly, Patient 66 and Patient 514 overlapped in the ICU in 2008 and had nearly identical clade B isolates with one shared SNV (1 bp upstream from start of ACICU_01396, a predicted MFS transporter)., Patients with persistent infections move among hospital locations during the course of treatment. Eleven patients contributed isolates obtained in more than one hospital, with transfer between a long-term care facility (LTCF) and the tertiary care hospital being the most common transfer route (four patients moved to LTCF, four patients were transferred from a LTCF to the main or regional hospitals). Patient 392 was infected with three different strains over the course of >800 days, each isolated during a stay at a different community hospital. Patient 225 was infected with a monophyletic set of strains from clade A over 170 days, with strains isolated during the patientâs stay at a LTCF, the main ICU ward, a community hospital, and again at the main ICU ward., Two lines of evidence suggest that natural selection is contributing to the range of SNVs and IS insertions observed in the series of longitudinal isolates from each patient. First, genes involved in antibiotic resistance and host interaction were significantly enriched for novel genetic variants. MDR strains have limited treatment options, resulting in an increased reliance on last-line therapies like colistin and tigecylcine. The pmrAB genes were the most frequently mutated, with 18 independent mutations and IS events observed. These mutations tended to occur in patients that had been treated with colistin: 12 patients had isolates with mutations in these loci, and at least nine of them received colistin therapy. Colistin treatment status was unknown for the other three patients due to incomplete patient histories. Mutations in pmrAB that arise during treatment have been described previously [47]. Ample evidence supports a role for the TCRS system PmrAB in regulation of colistin resistance in Ab through upregulation of pmrC, a lipid A phosphoethanolamine transferase [41, 42]. Some relationships between pmrAB mutation and colistin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were observed. For example, the MIC for isolate ABUH41489 with an ISAba125 interruption of pmrB was >128 ug/mL, while isolate ABUH41488 from the same patient, which had a pmrA mutation (I173F) had a MIC measured at 2 ug/mL. However, the majority of strains with pmr mutations had MIC values <2 Î¼g/mL, which is considered phenotypically susceptible in standard clinical assays (Additional file 2: Table S2). A recent study of the development of resistance in the context of colistin therapy in A. baumannii showed that clinical colistin resistance can go undetected by standard clinical methodologies [48]. Though phenotypically susceptible, pmrC expression values were significantly increased from 5-30-fold in three strains tested relative to their isogenic parental strains from the same patient (RNASeq data not shown). Thus the elevated pmrC expression suggests that pmrAB mutations in these strains may result in lipid A modifications that confer some level of protection from colistin. Mutations in lpxACD, encoding for lipid A biosynthesis pathway, have also been implicated in conferring colistin resistance [49]. We did not observe any mutations in the lpx genes, supporting the prediction that pmrAB mutations are likely to be the most commonly encountered colistin resistance mechanism in Ab in clinical settings due to a higher fitness cost of lpxACD mutations [50]., Another TCRS, adeRS, and its associated efflux system, adeABC, also had multiple independent mutations in this population, with 16 independent mutations and IS events in 12 patients. AdeRS regulates the expression of the adeABC efflux pump genes which are associated with resistance to several antibiotics including to tigecycline [51, 52]. Sequence variation is high in these genes as observed previously and related to tigecyline resistance [53]. Interestingly, only three patients with adeRS or adeABC mutations in this study were confirmed to have received tigecycline during treatment, while four did not, and five patients had inconclusive patient records. All adeRS and adeABC mutant isolates had tigecycline MIC values >2 Î¼g/mL (Additional file 2: Table S2), indicative of a resistant phenotype. Eight of the 14 mutations were patient-specific, meaning that even the initial isolate had the mutation. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the regulation of adeABC is under selection for more than just tigecycline efflux [51]. Mutations in the rpoB gene encoding RNA polymerase III can confer resistance to rifampin. Three isolates from two patients had rpoB mutations in the rifampin resistance determining region (RRDR) [54] and both patients received rifampin therapy in combination with colistin. This suggests that mutations in other multiply-mutated genes may also have adaptive value in the context of infection., MDR infections still have to persist in the context of the host immune system, and functional categories related to regulation of transcription, membrane transport, surface polysaccharide synthesis and organization, iron acquisition, and motility were enriched in mutations. Mutations were observed in the tyrosine kinase wzc gene involved in mediating capsular polysaccharide organization [55â57]. Notably, several mutations occurred in genes encoding iron acquisition and siderophores with potential implications for iron acquisition during host infection. The enrichment in transcription factors in SNV and IS events raises the question of how the transcriptional landscape changes during infection. For example, the histidine kinase component of an uncharacterized TCRS, ACICU_03157, had both SNVs and IS mediated changes in this population., The second line of evidence of a role for natural selection in the set of observed SNVs is the elevated ratio of non-synonymous variants compared to the population-wide average (Table 2). Isolate-and patient-specific SNVs were much more likely to be non-synonymous than SNVs observed in isolates from multiple patients. SNVs in multiply-hit genes also have higher non-synonymous ratios at the population level compared to the population mean ((NS)/(NSâ+âS)â=â0.18) (Additional file 5: Table S5), suggesting that these genes may be subject to diversifying selection, in contrast to those genes below the population-wide value. For example the iron-related genes, ACICU_01673, ACICU_01696, ACICU_02572, and ACICU_02581, all have population-wide ((NS)/(NSâ+âS) >0.35. Furthermore, siderophore synthesis genes, transporters, and TCRS, were also observed in strain-specific SNVs in an Ab outbreak [58]. Functional gene enrichment findings are also in agreement with other longitudinal studies including persistent and asymptomatic Burkholderia pseudomallei infection which had key changes in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and modification [10], and those observed during 12 weeks of Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection that included transporters and antibiotic resistance genes [4]. Lieberman et al. (2014) found extensive diversity of Burkholderia dolosa in individual CF patients, with multiple adaptive mutations appearing, but few becoming fixed in the population over time [6]. In a longitudinal study of over 400 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from 34 CF patients, convergent evolution was identified in several genes involved in host adaptation based on remodeling of regulatory networks [59]. An alternative explanation, however, for the elevated rate of non-synonymous mutations is that there has not been adequate time for deleterious mutations to be removed from the population. This alternative hypothesis predicts that over time the fraction of non-synonymous mutations would decline. More extensive sampling of infected patients will be required to better understand the spectrum of mutations that arise during infection and make inferences about their functional effect., Hospital-acquired infections are generally considered acute and treatable. Increasing rates of antibiotic resistance are changing that perception. Strains resistant to all FDA-approved drugs now represent a significant fraction of Ab infections in many hospitals and have led to long-term infections that are difficult to treat. Relatively few studies have examined the evolution of bacterial pathogens during long-term infections. We found that patients persistently infected with MDR Ab are due to both treatment failure and re-infection with new strains. Multiple examples were found of patients infected with the same strain for >150 days. Patient movement data highlight the need to monitor patients with a history of MDR Ab as they are admitted to a new hospital unit., A limitation of this study is that serial sampling of infected patients was not performed in a systematic or prospective manner, but relied on a convenience sample that may introduce biases. Another limitation is that a single isolate was sequenced from each culture date and so we were not able to evaluate the population of variants that were present in a patient at any given time. In some cases the retrospective sampling design does not distinguish between co-occurring, replacement, or re-infection scenarios. To more rigorously distinguish between these classifications, multiple isolates from multiple time points need to be analyzed. Nonetheless, we were able to show that both long-term infections and super-infections with genetically distinct strains are common., Genomic analysis of A. baumannii isolates collected from the same patient over time revealed enrichment in mutations associated with antibiotic and host responses, including those encoding for transcriptional regulators, cell surface structures, and iron utilization. Most mutations were isolate-specific, yet enrichment analysis suggests that the much of the genetic variation detected is under selection.,

                Background
                As whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) transition from research tools to clinical diagnostic tests, it is increasingly critical for sequencing methods and analysis pipelines to be technically accurate. The Genome in a Bottle Consortium has recently published a set of benchmark SNV, indel, and homozygous reference genotypes for the pilot whole genome NIST Reference Material based on the NA12878 genome.
              
                Methods
                We examine the relationship between human genome complexity and genes/variants reported to be associated with human disease. Specifically, we map regions of medical relevance to benchmark regions of high or low confidence. We use benchmark data to assess the sensitivity and positive predictive value of two representative sequencing pipelines for specific classes of variation.
              
                Results
                We observe that the accuracy of a variant call depends on the genomic region, variant type, and read depth, and varies by analytical pipeline. We find that most false negative WGS calls result from filtering while most false negative WES variants relate to poor coverage. We find that only 74.6 % of the exonic bases in ClinVar and OMIM genes and 82.1 % of the exonic bases in ACMG-reportable genes are found in high-confidence regions. Only 990 genes in the genome are found entirely within high-confidence regions while 593 of 3,300 ClinVar/OMIM genes have less than 50 % of their total exonic base pairs in high-confidence regions. We find greater than 77 % of the pathogenic or likely pathogenic SNVs currently in ClinVar fall within high-confidence regions. We identify sites that are prone to sequencing errors, including thousands present in publicly available variant databases. Finally, we examine the clinical impact of mandatory reporting of secondary findings, highlighting a false positive variant found in BRCA2.
              
                Conclusions
                Together, these data illustrate the importance of appropriate use and continued improvement of technical benchmarks to ensure accurate and judicious interpretation of next-generation DNA sequencing results in the clinical setting.

Finally, we examine the clinical impact of mandatory reporting of secondary findings, highlighting a false positive variant found in BRCA2., Together, these data illustrate the importance of appropriate use and continued improvement of technical benchmarks to ensure accurate and judicious interpretation of next-generation DNA sequencing results in the clinical setting., As whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) transition from research tools to clinical diagnostic tests, it is increasingly critical for sequencing methods and analysis pipelines to be technically accurate. To interpret appropriately the results of any clinical test, the informed clinician should have a working knowledge of the accuracy and diagnostic characteristics of the test. Initial evaluations suggest that SNV and INDEL genotype calls can vary based on exome capture kit, sequencing platform, and the aligner and variant caller [1â9]. An absence of technical benchmark data and evaluation methods prompted the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to convene the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) Consortium to develop infrastructure to address this problem. The consortium is developing and disseminating Reference Materials, Reference Data, and Reference Methods for human genome sequencing., The complex nature of the human genome presents significant challenges to achieving technical accuracy in clinical sequencing (Fig. 1). A human genome contains 3.2 billion basepairs (bp) consisting of 50â69 % repetitive sequence [10] encompassing transposable elements (LINES, SINES, and Long Terminal Repeats), low complexity regions (such as homopolymers), and pseudogenes. Larger insertions, deletions, and rearrangements within the genome, often termed structural variants, are not represented in a reference sequence and thus present additional complexity in alignment. A total of 19,000â21,000 protein coding genes comprise 1â2 % of the genome [11], and the size of protein-coding genes is variable. RefSeq genes have a median of six exons per gene with the titin (TTN) containing the highest number of exons: 363. Certain disease-related genes are particularly complex, such as the highly paralogous families of transmembrane ion channels, many of which are associated with cardiac arrhythmias and excitatory abnormalities in the nervous system [12]. The challenges of repetitive, paralogous sequence and structural variation complicate the analysis of clinical WGS and WES data. Not only is short-read sequencing prone to false negative or false positive variant calls due to systematic sequencing errors, but the repetitive nature of the genome introduces global mapping and local alignment challenges [13].
                    Fig. 1
                      Complexity of the Genome. a The genome consists of several (overlapping) regions. Eighty-six percent of 35 bp sequences and 95 % of 100 bp sequences are unique to one location in the reference genome. b A total of 50.6 % of the non-N reference genome falls into a repeat (data from RepeatMasker). c There is great variation in exon count and number of exonic bases per gene (data from RefSeq). d An unrooted phylogenetic tree derived from multiple alignment of cDNA sequences of 10 voltage-gated sodium channel genes within the human genome illustrates the complexity evolutionary relationship of paralogous sequences which complicates the process of short-read alignment in next-generation sequencing. A related voltage gated calcium channel CACNA1L is included as an outgroup
                    , Over the last several years many groups have demonstrated the clinical utility of genome sequencing [14â17], developing tools for clinical interpretation of individuals [18], families [19], and for rapid genetic diagnosis [20â24]. Themes throughout this work include low concordance across platforms for insertion-deletion variants, and moderate concordance between interpreters of genomic variants [1, 5, 25]., In this analysis, we characterize the GIAB [26] high-confidence regions, benchmark WGS and WES example variant calls in relation to publicly available high-confidence consensus SNV, indel, and homozygous reference genotypes for NA12878, and evaluate the clinical impact of genomic sites with systematic errors from one or more sequencing platforms. We use the WGS and WES benchmark to investigate the causes of extra and missing variants in two call sets (putative false positive and false negative variants, respectively). We focus on potentially functionally significant variants. Finally, we compare performance across the whole genome to performance for different types of potentially functional variants in genes that have different levels of evidence for disease association and clinical actionability., We recently published a set of high-confidence SNV, indel, and homozygous reference genotypes for the pilot whole genome NIST Reference Material 8398 [26]. Briefly these genotypes were generated by integrating 14 whole genome and exome sequencing datasets from five different technologies. When the datasets had discordant genotypes, we arbitrated between them using characteristics of bias typically used for filtering variants, such as strand bias, mapping quality, and clipping of reads. Specifically, at sites with discordant genotypes, we used genotypes from datasets that did not have characteristics of bias. If the reason for the discordant genotypes could not be automatically determined using the characteristics of bias (for example, if datasets with no evidence of bias disagreed), then the variant and surrounding region was excluded from the high-confidence regions. Additionally, we excluded regions if all datasets had evidence of bias or fewer than 5 reads with mapping quality >10. We also excluded regions in which current sequencing technologies are prone to errors (specifically, long homopolymers and tandem repeats, segmental duplications, and putative structural variants). The resulting high-confidence calls and high-confidence regions for this pilot genome, based on DNA from subject NA12878, are rapidly being adopted by clinical and research labs to obtain performance metrics such as sensitivity and false discovery rate for new library preparation and informatics methods [3, 27â32]., One whole genome and one Nextera-based whole exome sequencing dataset from the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform were used in this work. The coverage of coding regions by the Nextera exome kit was found to be better than other standard exome kits, but worse than newer enhanced exome library preparation methods like âaugmented exome sequencingâ [33]. This sequencing was performed in 2013 and 2014 by two participating institutions of the Genome in a Bottle Consortium: NIST and the Garvan Institute of Medical Research. The sequencing was done on the candidate NIST Reference Material 8398, a large batch of DNA extracted from the cell line GM12878. The cell line is archived at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research. These measurements represent typical approaches that were broadly used at the time of this study., Whole genome sequencing of 150âÃâ150 bp paired end reads was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 with PCR-free v2 chemistry at NIST. These data were from 12 flow cells on the same instrument and 14 replicate libraries prepared from a total of six tubes of candidate NIST RM 8398. The raw data were aligned using BWA MEM v.0.7.5a with default parameters [34]. Reads from each library from each lane were independently realigned using GATK v.2.8-1-g932cd3a IndelRealigner, followed by Base Quality Score Recalibration following GATK Best Practices [35]. Then, all reads from all runs and libraries were combined for a second round of GATK IndelRealigner. The reads were randomly downsampled from approximately 300Ã to 30Ã coverage to give a typical level of coverage for WGS. Note that this amounted to 31Ã coverage within the Nextera exome capture regions. Even though these data are from multiple libraries and runs, we expect that these should represent typical data for the purposes of this work, though they may contain slightly fewer errors since errors from any particular library would be diluted by combining with other libraries. Variants were called using Platypus v.0.5.2 including assembly-based calling to test a new pipeline that was recently proposed for clinical variant calling [36]. Variants were filtered using the defaults for Platypus (that is, GOF, badReads, alleleBias, hp10, Q20, HapScore, MQ, strandBias, SC, QualDepth, REFCALL, and QD) [36]. Separately, INDELs were called using Scalpel [37] version 0.3.2 in single sample mode for CCDS regions with default settings. The entire 300Ã dataset and the 30Ã downsampled bam file are available on the GIAB ftp site at NCBI: ftp://âftp-trace.âncbi.ânlm.ânih.âgov/âgiab/âftp/âdata/âNA12878/âNIST_âNA12878_âHG001_âHiSeq_â300x/â., Approximately 50Ã coverage whole exome sequencing was performed on a library prepared using the Nextera rapid capture exome kit at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research. The raw read data were aligned using BWA and variants were called using GATK HaplotypeCaller v.2.7-2-g6bda569 [35]. No filtering was applied. Note that the variant calling pipelines for WES differs from that of the WGS. The vcf file used is available on the GIAB ftp site at NCBI: ftp://âftp-trace.âncbi.ânlm.ânih.âgov/âgiab/âftp/âdata/âNA12878/âanalysis/âGARVAN_âsnps_âindels_â12172013/âproject.âNIST.âhc.âsnps.âindels.âvcf Separately, INDELs were called using Scalpel [37] version 0.3.2 in single sample mode for CCDS regions with default settings., We compared the WGS and WES calls to the latest version of high-confidence calls from GIAB, which integrates multi-platform integrated calls from NIST with two phased pedigree call sets from Real Time Genomics and the Illumina Platinum Genomes Project (from: ftp://âftp-trace.âncbi.ânlm.ânih.âgov/âgiab/âftp/ârelease/âNA12878_âHG001/âGIABPedigreev0.â2/â). To compare different representations of complex variants (that is, nearby SNVs and/or indels), we used the freely available Real Time Genomics tool vcfeval (ftp://âftp-trace.âncbi.ânlm.ânih.âgov/âgiab/âftp/âtools/âRTG/â). The resulting calls in the test sets that were included (true positives), extra (false positives), and missing (false negatives) in the benchmark were then annotated for potential functional effect., We annotated variant call sets with Sequence to Medical Phenotypes (STMP), which employs a custom Annovar-based tool to integrate data into a tabular format from 94 sources, including segmental duplications, repetitive elements, ClinVar and OMIM annotations, and performs separate functional annotations with transcript information from NCBI RefSeq, Ensembl, and UCSC [1, 38]. The data were further sorted and variants tabulated with custom python scripts. Individual variants were manually curated for technical validity (JZ) and potential clinical relevance (MG)., We define two gene sets. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) reportable genes list contains the 56 genes that the ACMG recommend for pathogenic variant discovery and reporting [39]. Though it contains only a fraction of important disease-related genes, we selected the list because it represents an externally defined minimal set of genes where performance must meet clinical standards. It also represents a group of genes felt to be medically actionable, a group where we would hope for optimal technical performance. The second gene set contains genes derived from the ClinVar and OMIM catalogs to represent a total of 3,300 genes with known relationship to human disease., The 35 bp uniqueness scores and 100 bp alignability data were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser. The Z bp uniqueness metric indicates whether the sequence (of length-Z) beginning at that base is unique in the genome, while the 100 bp âalignabilityâ metric tolerates up to two mismatches., The 100 bp uniqueness scores were created by breaking the reference into 100 bp fragments and aligning with Bowtie (allowing no gaps and only accepting unique alignments, options: âv0 âbest âm1)., We defined sites with systematic errors as sites that were first determined to be homozygous reference by the Genome in a Bottle arbitration process, and second, a non-homozygous reference genotype was called from any sequencing platforms that had reads containing a variant at the site. Specifically, we considered a site to have a systematic error if all sequencing datasets from a platform had evidence for an incorrect genotype or if more than two sequencing datasets from a platform had evidence for an incorrect genotype. No filtering was performed and all variants with a quality score >2 were called using GATK v2.8-1. A low quality score threshold was used to be more comprehensive in finding sites that might have bias. These sites can be downloaded from the GIAB ftp site (ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/NA12878/analysis/NIST_union_callsets_06172013/NISTIntegratedCalls_14datasets_131103_allcall_UGHapMerge_HomRef_VQSRv2.18_all_bias_nouncert_excludesimplerep_excludesegdups_excludedecoy_excludeRepSeqSTRs_noCNVs.vcf.gz), and the platform or platforms with systematic errors are listed in the INFO field, âplatformbiasâ. We used bedtools [40] to intersect the coordinates of these variants with those in annotation databases and custom perl scripts to filter out variants in annotation databases with different alternative alleles., We restricted benchmarking to regions of the Genome in a Bottle reference material determined to be high confidence. As described above and in our previous work [26], we excluded regions from the high-confidence regions if they were low coverage, prone to mapping error (paralogous sequences, repetitive elements, structural variants, and segmental duplications) or systematic errors in all sequencing chemistries (repetitive elements, low-complexity regions). We characterized the high-confidence regions in terms of uniqueness, repeat sequences, and the proportion of the genome and exome that fall inside these high-confidence regions., In the high-confidence regions, we assessed the accuracy of variant calls from Illumina whole genome (BWA MEM followed by Platypus) and Illumina Nextera exome sequencing (BWA followed by GATK)., We compared the performance for different types of potentially functional SNVs in medically relevant genes from ClinVar/OMIM as well as genome wide. For all functional annotations (non-synonymous, synonymous, splicing, and truncating) WGS enabled equal or higher average sensitivity compared to WES (Table 1). Similarly, for INDELs, sensitivity was higher for WGS (72.7 %) than WES (22.7 %) within consensus coding and high-confidence regions using Scalpel [37].Table 1

                      Sensitivity for different categories of potentially functional variants across different gene categories. Parentheses contain 95 % binomial confidence intervals
                    , False negatives and false positives arise for different reasons in each platform. For WES, poor read depth was the primary driver of sensitivity as 95 % of false negative variants (FNVs) fell within regions having a read coverage of <10. Note that variant calls remained consistent with increased overall coverage (Additional file 1: Table S1). Further analysis of FNVs revealed that 16 % of whole genome FNVs fall inside simple repeats, low complexity regions, or satellite repeats, compared to 8.6 % of whole exome FNVs. In contrast, 16 % of whole exome FNVs are in regions with GC content >75 %, compared to <1 % of whole genome FNVs., For WGS, most FNVs resulted from filtering by Platypus due to their presence within difficult-to-sequence and/or difficult-to-call regions. Specifically, 87 % of FNVs were called but removed by filtering using the default parameterization of Platypus (that is, low base qualities, allele frequency, homopolymers >10 bp, variant quality <20, too many haplotypes, low mapping quality, strand bias, low complexity regions). Thirty-six percent of whole genome FNVs fell within the short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE) class of repetitive elements, compared to 13 % of all whole genome bases residing within SINEs, and less than 1 % of FNVs within genic SINEs. Since most FNVs for WGS calls in the whole genome were caused by filtering, we characterized which filters were most and least specific in distinguishing likely false positives from likely true positives (Additional file 2: Table S2). The least specific filters for Platypus were haplotype score (HapScore), mapping quality (MQ), sequence context (SC), and QUAL by depth (QD). When these were the only filters, they contained only 3 % to 5 % false positives and together made up 77 % of the FNVs. In contrast, strandBias, a filter indicating that a significantly higher proportion of variants falls on one sequencing strand compared to the other, contained 68 % false positives when it occurred on its own or 99 % false positives when it occurred in addition to another filter. In general, sites with multiple reasons for filtering had a higher false positive rate (39 %) than all filtered sites (15 %). These results highlight the importance of characterizing and tuning filters to obtain the most accurate and complete call-set possible [41]., Less than 3 % of variants in both whole genome and exome sequencing were absent from benchmark calls but fell within high-confidence regions; therefore, one could consider these variants false positives. However, manual inspection of alignments around these variants suggests a variety of etiologies, so we instead call them questionable variants (QVs). For WES, most QVs were correctly identified as non-reference but had incorrect genotypes due to insufficient coverage (for example, the sites were identified as homozygous variant when they were in fact heterozygous). Since exome variant calls were unfiltered, there were also a few QVs that were likely to be systematic sequencing errors; these had clear evidence of strand bias and would be easily filtered if a strand bias filter were applied, including a variant rs200691513 (K856N) in the clinically-relevant, ACMG gene DSG2, which is associated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. For WGS, almost all of the QVs represent difficulties in our simple classification schema, in that many likely represent true variants occurring near the boundary between high-confidence and low-confidence regions. In fact, except for a series of seven QVs in SERPINA1 (discussed below), all six of the remaining synonymous and non-synonymous QVs in ClinVar/OMIM genes were within 50 bp of the inside edge of high-confidence regions. Complex variants are occasionally missing from the high-confidence calls as they overlap the borders of the high and low confidence delineation. Therefore, we recommend manual inspection of QVs near the edge of high-confidence regions., In one particular region, appropriate alignments and variant calls against the hg19 reference yielded a series of five synonymous and two non-synonymous phased heterozygous QVs between chr14:94844936-94844975 in the gene, SERPINA1 (Additional file 3: Figure S1a). As shown in Additional file 3: Figure S1b, this gene resides within a larger region that has a curation issue from the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC Curation Issue HG-1930, http://âwww.âncbi.ânlm.ânih.âgov/âprojects/âgenome/âassembly/âgrc/âhuman/âissues/â?âid=âHG-1930). These variants are contained in a new alternative sequence that is part of GRCh38 constructed from the 1000 Genomes decoy reference sequence. The GeT-RM browser allows a BLAST search of the sequence in a region, revealing the same series of SNVs in the homologous sequence (Additional file 3: Figure S1c). These seven variants were classified as QVs, because they come from an alternate locus that is unlocalized in the reference assembly. This result highlights that future work is needed to further understand how alternate loci in GRCh38 will be employed in variant calling pipelines to minimize the types of errors classified as QVs and FNVs in our analysis., Short-read sequencing technologies and analysis pipelines are prone to systematic errors at some genomic locations. These systematic errors may result from PCR amplification, errors sequencing particular sequence contexts, local alignment errors, and/or global mapping errors. We identified 39,301 loci where the benchmark data contain a high-confidence homozygous reference call, but at least one sequencing technology incorrectly called a variant. For this analysis, we define these positions as sites with systematic errors. Strikingly, 7,467 of these variants are present in one or more of the following databases: ClinVar, ESP, 1000 Genomes, COSMIC, and dbSNP (Table 2). These variants in publicly available databases may arise from two sources: they may be false positives that were submitted to the databases, or they may be real variants in the population that are not present in the NA12878 genome. In the first case, systematic sequencing errors interpreted as true positives may detrimentally affect algorithms that use these databases, such as GATK Base Quality Score Recalibration. In the second case, it may be difficult to distinguish between real variants and systematic sequencing errors at these positions in any individual. Of note, only four sites with systematic errors were in ClinVar, all of which were indels in homopolymers from Ion Torrent sequencing experiments, and would likely be filtered by Ion Torrent Variant Caller, which calls more accurately in such contexts (Additional file 4: Table S3). These four sites appeared likely to represent real, disease-associated variants previously reported in other individuals, including a truncating variant in BRCA2 discussed below.Table 2

Towards this goal, we calculated the proportion of exonic bases present in the high-confidence regions for each ACMG gene (Fig. 2a). In total, 82.1 % of exonic bases in ACMG genes are in high confidence regions. Individual genes ranged from 0 % to 100 % of exonic bases in high-confidence regions. Table 3 displays the reason for low confident bases in ACMG genes. The most common reasons for low confidence were overlapping with STRs or segmental duplications found in previous studies [42] or purported structural variants in dbVar from NA12878.

Surprisingly, only 74.6 % of ClinVar and OMIM genesâ exonic bases and 72.7 % of the exonic bases in all coding genes are found in high-confidence regions. Of the 18,667 coding genes, 990 were 100 % within high-confidence regions; these genes tend to be smaller (mean: 1,787 bp) than the rest (mean: 3,371 bp)., Large portions of clinically important genes fall outside of the high-confidence regions. A total of 593 of 3,300 ClinVar and OMIM genes have less than 50 % of the exonic bases in high-confidence regions and 2,616 of 18,667 coding genesâ exonic bases are entirely excluded from high-confidence regions., We also examined ClinVar and OMIM genes at the exon-level; Fig. 2c shows the distribution of the proportion of first, second, middle, penultimate, and last exons inside the high-confidence regions. Notably, first exons have a lower than average proportion of their bases in high-confidence regions, which is likely explained by the well-known higher GC content in first exons., The repetitive sequences in the reference assembly frequently cause difficulties in short-read alignment since a sequence read from a repeated region could align with equal probability to multiple locations. In these situations, results vary by aligner (and chosen alignment parameters); the read will be either: (1) placed randomly in any one of the equally best locations; (2) placed in all possible locations; or (3) not aligned at all. Aligning to repetitive sequences is particularly problematic if the patientâs genome contains a variant in one copy of a repeated sequence but not in other copies. In this case, misaligned sequence reads can create false positive or false negative variant calls, which could have clinical significance. Clearly, less repetitive regions (that is, more unique sequence) allow for improved alignments and thus improved variant calls. Therefore, we examined the uniqueness of the sequences in high and low confidence regions. We found that 90.6 % of 35 bp sequences in high-confidence regions are unique to one location in the genome compared to 47.5 % of 35 bp sequences in low-confidence regions (Fig. 3a). Further, we evaluated the fraction of each RepeatMasker repeat class in high-confidence regions. Many classes of repeats â particularly low complexity (48.6 %), simple repeats (18.5 %), and microsatellites (28.3 %) â are infrequently seen in high-confidence regions (Fig. 3b).  These repetitive regions are depleted in the current high-confidence regions because regions with low mapping quality or long repeats and segmental duplications are explicitly excluded to form conservative high-confidence calls. More work is needed to form high-confidence calls in these regions.

                      , To understand how these analyses would be used in practice, we characterized the genomic context of all pathogenic and likely pathogenic ClinVar SNVs, whether they were in NA12878 or not. 77.14 % of the pathogenic or likely pathogenic SNVs currently in ClinVar fall within high-confidence regions, 97.17 % are at the start of a 35 bp sequence that is only present once in hg19, and 98.11 % are at the start of a 100 bp sequence that is only present once in hg19 (with up to two mismatches). These values are even higher for likely pathogenic or pathogenic SNVs with > = level 2 ClinVar review status (Table 4) and are higher than genome-wide averages (Fig. 4).Table 4

                      , Subsequently, we looked at the distribution of ClinVar pathogenic variants within ACMG genes from 60,706 exomes in ExAC (Additional file 5: Table S4) [43]. Of the 5,146 positions classified as pathogenic, 423 were identified in this cohort. Several technical and ultimately clinical observations emerge. From the technical standpoint, a substantial number of variants were in low confidence regions (100), failed VQSR (38), had dramatically low coverage (32 were covered by less than 15 reads on average) or had suspiciously high coverage (three were covered by more than 100 reads on average) indicative of compression tracks within the reference. We examined the number of samples with uncalled genotypes as a function of read depth, and found that 26 of the 423 variant positions had low coverage and uncalled genotypes for over 1,000 of the 60,706 individuals (Fig. 5).

Orange indicates that the variant is in a high-confidence NA12878 region while blue is considered to be in low confidence. Triangles highlight variants that failed VQSR filtering
                      , To better understand the clinical impact of technical aspects of genome sequencing, we used high-confidence consensus calls from a benchmark genome to characterize clinically relevant genetic variation at the gene and variant level across the genome. We characterized the high-confidence regions and examined the proportion of medically relevant genes that fall outside of high-confidence regions. , We report that large areas of key genes, as well as a significant proportion of known disease-causing variation, lie outside of high-confidence regions, highlighting the importance of technical accuracy in benchmarking clinical genomics. While less than 1,000 genes across the genome are found entirely within the high-confidence regions, it is perhaps more concerning that, of the genes we regard as most medically important â the âactionableâ list of 56 genes from the ACMG, only 82.1 % of their exonic structure is found within high-confidence regions. Indeed, the knowledge that nearly one fifth of each gene, for which laboratory directors are recommended to provide clinical reporting for every patient undergoing clinical exome or genome sequencing, would not reach consensus across different chemistries and pipelines, is sobering. But it is a call to arms for those interested in clinical grade technical accuracy for genome sequencing. We hope by highlighting and scrutinizing the challenging areas of the genome, we can optimize our pipelines for greater consensus and, at the very least, provide transparency regarding our confidence level in every call. In contrast with the lack of immediate personal implication of a false call in a discovery cohort study, a false call on a clinical report could have immediate detrimental consequences in the life of an individual, family, or disease community., Our analysis revealed false negatives and false positives in both WES and WGS. For exome sequencing, many of false negatives were due to low or no coverage, which emphasizes the importance of choosing a sequencing platform that adequately covers all medically-relevant genomic regions [33]. Most false negatives from WGS resulted from overly aggressive filtering., In one example of a false positive from our systematic error call set, one sequencing chemistry and one pipeline called a recognized, pathogenic frameshift deletion in BRCA2. Pathogenic variants in the BRCA genes are implicated in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (http://âwww.âncbi.ânlm.ânih.âgov/âbooks/âNBK1247/â). The variant, rs80359760, is currently categorized in ClinVar as pathogenic/likely pathogenic based on several entries from the Breast Cancer Information Core, the Sharing Clinical Reports Project, and the literature (http://âwww.âncbi.ânlm.ânih.âgov/âclinvar/âvariation/â52831/â). Based on GIABâs consensus sequence, this variant is known to be a false positive call for this patient. However, it might be reported to another patient as an incidental finding, and one with evidence for pathogenicity that might even lead to medical action. Examples like this highlight the importance of confirmatory testing by an orthogonal method. Additionally, we hope that our analyses and the reference materials can provide helpful meta-data for bioinformatics analysis of loci such as these, since this dataset allows positions with systematic biases and medically relevant annotations in public databases to be identified [44, 45]., Our findings highlight the influence of informatic choices upon the final variant calls. For example, the newest human reference GRCh38 employs alternate contigs, encompassing a more accurate but complex representation of normal human variation. To maximize the benefit from this significant advance requires the development of mapping, variant calling, and variant comparison [46] software that recognizes complex variation (for example, SERPINA1 variation corresponding to an alternate locus in GRCh38, see Results) [47]. Additionally, the choice of ethnicity-specific reference genomes has been shown to impact the sensitivity of variant calling [19]. Furthermore, differences within the annotation schema employed may also influence the clinical impact of the call set [48]. Within the ACMG 56 genes in the NA12878 true positive confident call set, there were five variants that were annotated differently by one of the three gene models employed (see Additional file 6: Table S5). For example, the voltage-gated sodium channel, SCN5A, is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and long QT syndromes and  displays a complex developmentally-regulated pattern of multiple splice isoforms [49]. Though the common variant rs6599230 is unlikely to be of functional significance, it was annotated as a synonymous variant p.A29A using Refgene and Gencode transcript models, and alternately annotated as a non-synonymous variant p.Q32R with a UCSC Knowngene transcript model. Each of these annotations is a true and accurate representation, each corresponding to a different splice isoform and supported by either computationally-predicted or manually-curated transcript data. However, among the multiplicity of variants, it is not clear which (or all) of these should be displayed to the ordering clinician for the purposes of clinical decision-making. Disease domain specific expertise and standardization efforts, such as those already in process by the ClinGen Resource (http://âclinicalgenome.âorg/â) will prove necessary to develop the most clinically appropriate gene models or transcripts for a particular gene. Additionally, emerging resources such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project may provide relevant information for deconvoluting the isoform specific mutations in the tissue of interest., Using the reference materials developed by the Genome in a Bottle Consortium, we show that the predictive characteristics of WES and WGS for any given variant appear to depend on the genomic region, the class of variant, and the informatic tools employed. We discuss false positive and questionable variant calls from these reference materials that could significantly impact clinical care. Thus, the discussion of the technical aspects of clinical sequencing, and the continued development of reference materials to characterize more challenging parts of the genome, are critical steps toward enabling a better understanding of the predictive and technical characteristics of these tests.,

Classifying patients into subgroups with a common genetic etiology and applying treatments tailored to the specific molecular defect they carry is likely to improve management of neurodevelopmental disease in the future., Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs) refer to a complex collection of phenotypes that encompass clinically recognizable disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy and schizophrenia. The diagnosis of NDs has classically fallen within the clinical realm. The diagnosis of epilepsy is somewhat quantitative, with the frequency, onset and family history of seizure events being considered for classification [1], whereas the diagnosis of ASD, ID and schizophrenia is historically more complex. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM, currently DSM-5) is recognized by the US healthcare system as a standard battery of diagnostic criteria for classifying mental disorders. These criteria recognize patients with ASD as those with primarily communication deficits, which can be measured by several standardized tests (e.g., ADOS, ADI-R and BAPQ). In addition to intelligence quotient (IQ) testing, ID is classified by the DSM-5 as involving adaptive functioning impairments in the conceptual, social and practical skills domains. Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia must present with at least two disease-associated symptoms, which include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior, and social/occupational dysfunction [2]., Earlier versions of the DSM included phenotypic subtypes for many mental health disorders that have since been eliminated owing to inconsistent diagnoses between clinicians. However, the study of these disorders, ASD and ID in particular, has shown that disease subtypes do exist (such as high-functioning ASD, previously Asperger syndrome) [3]. Twin studies of ASD, epilepsy and schizophrenia showed that NDs have a strong genetic component (heritability [h2]â=â40â80 % [4â6], h2â=â70â88 % [7], and h2â=â64â81 % [8, 9], respectively). The existence of extensive comorbidity among ND diagnoses has long been recognized; for example, 28 % of individuals who have ID also present with ASD [10], whereas 26 % present with epilepsy [11] and 3.7â5.2 % with schizophrenia [12]. Phenotypic overlap between NDs led to an early hypothesis that common risk genes underlie multiple NDs and, furthermore, that genetic characterization could be a useful diagnostic tool for ND identification and treatment [13]., Studies of copy number variation and whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing (WES and WGS, respectively) of families have highlighted the importance of rare, de novo gene-disruptive mutations in the genetic etiology of NDs. These studies frequently implicated the same copy number variant, biochemical pathway or even the same gene as an underlying factor of seemingly diverse clinical and etiological outcomes (Table 1). One classic example of this genetic overlap is a microdeletion in chromosome 15q11.3, which has been associated with multiple NDs (ASD, ID, epilepsy and schizophrenia) [14]. At the single-gene level, exome sequencing studies have highlighted that specific loci, such as SYNGAP1, ARID1B and ADNP, are likely to contribute to both ASD and ID, whereas mutations in genes such as STXBP1 and WDR45 might contribute to ID and epilepsy but not ASD (Table 1). Recognition of this genetic overlap and the subtlety of the clinical diagnoses of NDs have led to the development of a so-called genotype-first approach, in which patients with a common genotype (i.e., a disruptive variation in the same gene) are collected for deep clinical phenotyping to define the specific disease attributes associated with each candidate ND risk gene [15]. This approach contrasts with phenotype-driven approaches, in which patients are collected on the basis of a shared clinical presentation and used to identify candidate risk genes post hoc.Table 1

                  , The goal of this Opinion is to review advances in the discovery of candidate genes based on next-generation sequencing of patients and the impact of these advances on refining specific subtypes of ND. Linking genotypes to deep clinical phenotypes (including information obtained through application of best-practice DSM-5 criteria, clinical dysmorphology assessment, analysis of family histories and electroencephalography) is providing important insight into ND risk gene models [16â18]. We propose that grouping patients on the basis of a shared genetic etiology is a critical first step in tailoring improved therapeutics to a defined subset of patients., The affordable application of next-generation sequencing in the clinical and research arenas has rapidly increased our understanding of the genetic variation that underlies NDs. Exome and targeted sequencing studies of patients with ND have revealed dozens of new genes emerging as high-risk candidate loci in recent years (Table 2). WES sequencing of patients with ASD led to estimates that 500â1000 genes contribute to disease etiology [19], whereas in ID this number is greater than 1000 [20]. Epilepsy and schizophrenia are thought to be less genetically heterogeneous, involving approximately 500 [21] and 600 [22] genes, respectively. Although associations between certain gene variants and ND risk have been consistently replicated (such as de novo disruptive mutations in CHD8, ADNP and DYRK1A [19] among ASD and ID simplex families), hundreds of ND risk genes remain undiscovered or have not been associated with NDs with sufficient statistical significance owing to ultra-low mutation frequencies in the patient population.Table 2

                  , We combined the results of multiple published WES, WGS and targeted sequencing studies including 5001â5922 individuals with ASD (single gene denominators varied owing to the variety of WES, WGS and targeted sequencing approaches used) [19, 23â28], 1284 individuals with ID [29â31], 274 individuals with epilepsy [32, 33] and 785 individuals with schizophrenia [34â36] to look for genetic overlap between these NDs. Using this large dataset (over 7000 individuals/families), we identified the top 25 genes that show an excess of disruptive (frameshift, splice, nonsense) gene mutations in disease cases when these individuals are compared with 45,376 controls drawn from the ExAC database [37], where neuropsychiatric cases were masked before analysis (Table 1). Although the number of individuals represented in each disease study differs and several genes reach only nominal significance, the identified genes clearly converge on common biochemical and neurodevelopmental pathways, such as synaptic function, chromatin remodeling, gene transcription and Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. Importantly, significance thresholds are likely to be highly conservative, as the ND studies that were included in the analysis only considered confirmed de novo events, whereas the ExAC database variants have not been filtered for population frequency and inheritance status is unknown. Using our large dataset of de novo mutations associated with ND we can apply a recurrent de novo simulation model which considers the size and evolutionary conservation of individual genes to calculate the likelihood of observing a number of de novo mutations in any given ND-associated gene [23]. In some cases we find that genes that were not statistically significant for overall disruptive mutational burden after Bonferroni correction (pâ<â10-6) of the Fisherâs exact test p value are indeed significant for recurrent de novo mutation burden â such as GRIN2B, which has a de novo p value of 0.001 after correction. Therefore, although some genes (e.g., GRIN2B) reach only nominal significance for an overall increased burden in disruptive mutations in ND cases compared with unaffected controls, based on a de novo model they may prove to be bona fide ND risk genes., The discovery of recurrently mutated genes has been used to successfully identify additional patients with disruptive mutations in these risk genes who, when collectively phenotyped, define new syndromic and sub-syndromic forms of ND [16â18]. These efforts have proceeded in parallel with the coordination of clinical exome sequencing of patients, which has led to the identification of dozens of individuals with the same type of rare molecular defect (Table 2). This coordination led to the emergence of refined patient checklists that enable a systematic reassessment of pediatric, neuroimaging, neurobehavioral and morphological features [15]. Such genotypeâphenotype studies have shown that individuals sharing a genetic etiology have more features in common than those they share with the general ND population. These observations have led to the description of both genetic and clinical subtypes of ND, some of which may be considered syndromic by clinicians., Many of the top ND risk genes identified in our analysis are correlated with an observable phenotype that may have been predicted based on our analysis (Tables 1 and 2). For example, CHD8 is an ASD-associated gene linked with macrocephaly and gastrointestinal dysfunction [16], whereas ADNP mutations are associated with ASD and the complete loss of expressive language [17]. Some genes seem to be predominantly associated with ID (e.g., ARID1B, ANKRD11, CTNNB1, STXBP1 and CHAMP1). SCN1A mutations have been primarily observed in epilepsy [38]. Other genes are strongly associated with epilepsy and ID (e.g., CHD2 and DYRK1A), often with very specific clinical manifestations (e.g., microcephaly and late-onset epilepsy in the case of patients with DYRK1A variants [18]. The potential contribution of some of these ND genes (e.g., SCN2A, CHD8 and POGZ; Table 1) to adult neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, is intriguing, although statistical significance supporting these associations is still lacking. The existence of such associations would suggest that mutations in these genes have broad phenotypic effects or variable expressivity that manifests as ND at different developmental stages. It will be important to identify families in which gene-disruptive mutations in these genes are segregated in order to explore phenotypic differences among the familial carriers., Beyond genetic subtypes, network-based approaches that more globally predict the effects of ND risk genes on molecular pathways have repeatedly shown an enrichment for synapse function and gene transcription/chromatin remodeling [19, 39]. Although these pathways remain the most statistically significant pathways found among ND datasets, other pathways have been identified, including interaction with SNARE proteins and vesicular transport pathways in epilepsy (pâ<â0.03) and FMRP targets in ASD, ID and epilepsy (pâ<â0.00001) [39]. Given the extensive locus heterogeneity of these diseases, pathway-defined âmolecular subtypesâ are likely to become the ultimate target for behavioral and pharmacological therapeutics., Each of these large functional networks can be further subdivided into smaller pathways, such as long-term potentiation, calcium signaling, postsynaptic density and synapse structure in the case of synaptic function, in which enrichment is driven by signals from de novo mutations in genes such as SYNGAP1, SCN2A, STXBP1, GRIN2B and SCN1A (Table 1). SCN2A and SCN1A are members of the same gene family of voltage-gated sodium channels that are responsible for the generation and propagation of action potentials and have been associated with seizure phenotypes in animal models [38]. Although SCN1A de novo mutations seem to be specific to epilepsy [38], we observe SCN2A de novo mutations in both ASD and ID (Table 1), which suggests that long-term potentiation has a role in multiple forms of ND. It is important to note, however, that we are classifying mutations using the primary clinical diagnosis under which each patientâs cohort was originally ascertained. As a large phenotypic overlap exists between NDs, we could reasonably hypothesize, for example, that patients with ASD or ID and an SCN2A mutation could also manifest with seizure phenotypes., An enrichment for synapse function in ND has been observed primarily in a subset of patients with ID, epilepsy and schizophrenia [39]. Many antipsychotic and psychotropic compounds have been developed to modulate synaptic function to treat comorbid conditions (hyperactivity, depression, anxiety, aggression and seizures) often associated with NDs. These medications may be used more effectively when applied to patients with a molecular perturbation in the relevant gene or pathway. For example, benzodiazepines (e.g., clonazepam) are a class of drugs that increase GABAA receptor activity and thus contribute to the inhibition of action potentials in the central nervous system, which are often overactive in seizure conditions [40]. Efforts are currently underway to specifically tailor benzodiazepines to treat patients with mutations in SCN2A and SCN1A [41, 42] (Dr. Raphael Bernier, personal communication). Clemizole, a compound approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, has been shown to mitigate some of the convulsive behavior of Scn1a mutant zebrafish [43]. Scn2a mutant mice are being used in the development of other similar sodium-channel-inhibiting compounds, including GS967 [44]., Studies of simplex ASD and ID families have highlighted an enrichment for gene-disruptive mutations in transcription and chromatin remodeling pathways (e.g., SWI/SNF complex, Wnt/Î²-catenin and mTOR) [19, 39, 45]. Wnt/Î²-catenin and mTOR pathways are involved in gene transcription, cell growth, migration and patterning during embryonic development [46, 47]. These pathways are closely linked to the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression and is thought to have a role in neural specification [48]. Understanding the molecular biology of these pathways may reveal additional therapeutic targets. ADNP, for example, is a transcription factor that interacts directly with the SWI/SNF complex. Davunetide, a derivative octapeptide of ADNP, has been shown to ameliorate some of the cognitive deficits in animal models with ADNP mutations, which is a promising line of therapeutic research for ADNP patients with similar defects [49]. Some ND-associated genes (Table 1) are simultaneously involved in chromatin remodeling and transcription, such as ARID1B [50] and CHD8 [51], which have been linked to the SWI/SNF and Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling pathways [16, 50] (Table 1) and are known to be important for proliferation of neural precursors [23, 39, 52].The study of genetic subtypes of ND associated with the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway â specifically DDX3X and CHD8 â suggests that mutations in this pathway are important in the very early stages of development [16, 53]. Importantly, mutations in DDX3X account for a large percentage of unexplained ID in female individuals (1â3 %) [53], which was overlooked in studies of ASD alone [54] (Table 1). The Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway is commonly dysregulated in cancer; over 40 compounds have been shown to modulate Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway activity in model systems or in vivo that might be considered for use in specific genetic subtypes of ND in the future [55]., Mutations in the mTOR pathway involving genes such as TSC and PTEN have also been implicated in tumorigenesis and ND owing to their role in transcription and cell growth [47]. Rapalogues, including sirolimus (rapamycin) and everolimus, which inhibit TORC1 and are commonly used to treat cancer, are currently under investigation to assess whether they can improve ASD-related symptoms in patients with TSC mutations [56]. Similar disease-modifying therapies might be useful to treat patients with other genetic subtypes of ND in which mTOR function is abrogated. However, the use of drugs targeting both Wnt/Î²-catenin and mTOR pathways will need to be carefully considered and fine-tuned for use in NDs to avoid adverse side effects. Although killing healthy cells in adults is an acceptable consequence of cancer treatment, this is not the case during pediatric brain development., The success of the genotype-first approach for subtyping NDs can be primarily attributed to technological advances that make WES and targeted sequencing fast and cost-effective. ND candidate gene discovery can be maximized by combining many datasets from overlapping conditions (e.g., ASD, ID, epilepsy and schizophrenia) to (1) increase the genetic evidence supporting individual ND risk gene models, (2) build stronger molecular interaction networks that implicate specific pathways in disease biology and (3) assess the robustness of genotypeâphenotype links. Beyond providing a potential genetic explanation for disease to families, our understanding of the biological pathways that are disrupted by specific variants is leading to improved assessment of disease risk in families and to the prospect of tailored treatments for patients with these debilitating diseases., Autism spectrum disorders, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Intellectual disability, Neurodevelopmental disorder, Whole-exome sequencing, Whole-genome sequencing"

                Background
                The study of human B cell response to dengue virus (DENV) infection is critical to understand serotype-specific protection and the cross-reactive sub-neutralizing response. Whereas the first is beneficial and thus represents the ultimate goal of vaccination, the latter has been implicated in the development of severe disease, which occurs in a small, albeit significant, fraction of secondary DENV infections. Both primary and secondary infections are associated with the production of poly-reactive and cross-reactive IgG antibodies.
              
                Methods
                To gain insight into the effect of DENV infection on the B cell repertoire, we used VH region high-throughput cDNA sequencing of the peripheral blood IgG B cell compartment of 19 individuals during the acute phase of infection. For 11 individuals, a second sample obtained 6 months later was analyzed for comparison. Probabilities of sequencing antibody secreting cells or memory B cells were estimated using second-order Monte Carlo simulation.
              
                Results
                We found that in acute disease there is an increase in IgG B cell diversity and changes in the relative use of segments IGHV1-2, IGHV1-18, and IGHV1-69. Somewhat unexpectedly, an overall low proportion of somatic hypermutated antibody genes was observed during the acute phase plasmablasts, particularly in secondary infections and those cases with more severe disease.
              
                Conclusions
                Our data are consistent with an innate-like antiviral recognition system mediated by B cells using defined germ-line coded B cell receptors, which could provide a rapid germinal center-independent antibody response during the early phase of infection. A model describing concurrent T-dependent and T-independent B cell responses in the context of DENV infection is proposed, which incorporates the selection of B cells using hypomutated IGHV segments and their potential role in poly/cross-reactivity. Its formal demonstration could lead to a definition of its potential implication in antibody-dependent enhancement, and may contribute to rational vaccine development efforts.

Its formal demonstration could lead to a definition of its potential implication in antibody-dependent enhancement, and may contribute to rational vaccine development efforts., Dengue, the most prevalent mosquito borne-viral disease in humans, is caused by four closely related serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) of the Flaviviridae family. The infection can be asymptomatic, produce a mild self-limited febrile disease lasting up to 10 days, or result in a severe disease with hemostatic and hemodynamic dysfunction [1, 2]. According to recent estimates, 390 million dengue infections occur each year, of which only 96 million reach the public health surveillance system [3]., DENV primarily infects dendritic cells and monocytes [4â6]. During the early stages of infection, a rapid, strong innate immune response is elicited, resulting in a systemic inflammatory immune response that explains the majority of symptoms of uncomplicated illness. Shortly after, an adaptive immune response manifests as the production of low-affinity IgM anti-DENV antibodies, and, later, high-affinity anti-DENV IgG-neutralizing antibodies that confer long-term protection to the infecting serotype (homotypic protection). However, primary infections are also associated with the production of low-affinity, non-neutralizing or sub-neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies against multiple DENV-serotypes that only confer partial short-term protection [7]., An almost paradigmatic feature of dengue infection is the epidemiological observation that severe illness is associated with a previous infection with a different DENV serotype [8]. Non-neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies induced during primary infections have been implicated in potentiating viral replication, systemic immunopathology, and severe disease by FcÎ³R-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), offering a plausible explanation of the increased disease severity after multiple reinfections [9]., Antibody production is the result of B cell clonal selection, expansion, and differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. In the case of protein antigens, antigen-specific B cells are clonally selected and form germinal centers (GC) depending on T cell help. Within the GC, selected B cells undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) [10, 11], which are two mechanistically coupled processes resulting in high affinity IgG-switched memory B (mB) cells and antibody-secreting plasma cells [12]. However, it has become increasingly clear that B cell memory is heterogeneous in terms of their origin and function [13]. In the context of DENV infection, the generation of long-lived anti-DENV IgG+ memory cells selected by a primary infection has been implicated in the predominance of neutralizing antibodies against the primary infecting serotype over neutralizing antibodies specific for a different serotype causing a secondary infection [14]. Presumably, this so-called original antigenic sin could also favor ADE by outcompeting secondary serotype anti-DENV high-affinity B cell clones. Consistently, poly-reactive and serotype cross-reactive IgGs are present in high titers in early primary and secondary DENV infections [15â19]. Thus, understanding B cell responses to DENV infection as well as antibody-mediated immune protection and enhancement requires the integrative analysis of the clonal selection process within the actual conceptual framework of pathway heterogeneity of effector B cell differentiation [13]., Given the central role of antibodies and their affinity in the protection against DENV and their implication in severe disease, we hypothesized that the B cell clonal selection process and diversification may be different between primary and secondary dengue infections, and between DENV infections without clinical warning signs (DWSâ) and dengue infections with clinical warning signs (DWS+). To identify these differences, we used high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of peripheral blood IgG antibody repertoires derived from cDNA (reviewed in [20, 21]) to compare clonal diversity, IGHV usage, and SHM rates between patients with acute DWSâ and DWS+ and their corresponding post-convalescent blood samples (6 months after)., We found differential changes in IGHV1-2, IGHV1-18, and IGHV1-69 clonal usage frequency and transcription. Paradoxically, we observed overall lower SHM rates during acute illness, particularly in DWS+ and in lymphocytes using IGHV1-2, suggesting their implication in cross-reactive low-affinity IgG antibodies. Our results also suggest that in humans infected with DENV, in addition to a classical GC pathway, an alternative GC-independent effector B cell differentiation pathway may take place, in which CSR to IgG is decoupled from SHM., This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Research, Ethics and Biosafety Committees of the Instituto Nacional de Salud PÃºblica (CI:1023/1100), Universidad Veracruzana, Integral Molecular and Instituto de DiagnÃ³stico y Referencia EpidemiolÃ³gicos (InDRE). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants., During dengue season 2010 and 2011, 19 adult patients with clinical and laboratory confirmed DENV infection living in Veracruz, a DENV endemic zone in Mexico [22], were enrolled after providing written informed consent. Patients were classified as DWS+ if they required hospitalization, had hematocritâ>â40, a platelet countâ<â100âÃâ103, and at least one of the following signs: abdominal pain or tenderness, persistent vomiting, clinical fluid accumulation, mucosal bleeding, lethargy, restlessness, or liver enlargement (>2 cm). Patients donated two peripheral blood samples to provide total RNA and serum: one during the febrile stage (acute sample) and the other 6 months after recovery (post-convalescent sample), coinciding with the low transmission season to minimize the possibility of asymptomatic reinfection. For some data analyses, an additional control group of 10 healthy volunteers enrolled in an influenza vaccination study [23], was included. Peripheral blood was collected to obtain serum and total RNA. For RNA isolation, 2.5 ml of peripheral blood in PaxGene RNA tubes (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) was used according to manufacturerâs instructions and stored at â70 Â°C until use., All sera were tested with reference anti-NS1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with the Platelia Dengue NS1 Ag Test (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France) and Dengue IgM (PanbioÂ®, Sinnamon Park, QLD, Australia). To discriminate between primary and secondary infections, we used the IgG Capture ELISA (PanbioÂ®). Primary cases were defined as a positive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), NS1, and/or anti-IgM ELISA and negative anti-IgG ELISA. Secondary cases were defined as positive anti-IgG ELISA and NS1/or RT-PCR, regardless of the results of the anti-IgM ELISA., Viral RNA was isolated from the sera during the acute febrile phase (QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit, Qiagen) and used to determinate DENV serotype by quantitative RT-PCR according to the protocol of InDRE, Mexico [24], and the Official Mexican Norm: NOM-032-SSA-2002 [25]., DENV reporter virus particles (RVPs) for the four serotypes [26] were pre-incubated with an equal volume of all serially diluted acute sera (1:10 to 1:10,240; all dilutions were pre-incubated with RVPs) in complete Dulbeccoâs Modified Eagle Medium for 1 h at room temperature with slow agitation. Following incubation, BHK DC-SIGN cells were added to each well at a density of 30,000 cells per well, followed by incubation at 37 Â°C in 5 % CO2 for 72 h. Cells were subsequently lysed and analyzed for luciferase luminescent reporter expression. The percent infection for each concentration of serum was calculated using Prism software 5.0 and raw data expressed as percent infection versus log10 of the reciprocal serum dilution. A sigmoidal doseâresponse curve with a variable slope was applied to determine the titer of antibody that achieved a 50 % reduction in infection (50 % neutralization titer, NT50). Maximum infection was determined using a no serum control. An NT50ââ¥â1:50 was defined as a positive neutralization test., The RNA concentration and integrity was analyzed through capillary electrophoresis in an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer, with the RNA 6000 Pico kit. cDNA was generated for the VH region of IgG through 5â² rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR, using a protocol modified from the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). The forward primer (FpAmpTA) was a modification from the UPM primer to which we added to the 5â² end an A adapter from the platform GS FLX Titanium 454-Roche. The reverse primer TBIgGHu [5â²-(454adaptorB)CTA TGC GCC TTG CCA GCC CGC (454key) TCAG(IGHG)ACC GAT GGG CCC TTG GTG-3â²] primes in Exon I of the IGH
                           G genes and has the B adapter for the 454-Roche sequencing [27]. We analyzed the 500â600 bp 5â²RACE-PCR products with 1.5 % agarose gel electrophoresis and purified them with a MiniElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Their concentration and integrity was analyzed through capillary electrophoresis in a 2100 BioAnalyzer using the High Sensitivity DNA 2100 LabChip (Agilent Technologies)., We used 100 ng of each library for the emulsion PCR (GS emPCR Kit, 454-Roche). HTS was performed using Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium System 454-Roche with the GS LR70 Sequencing Kit according to the manufacturerâs instructions. This platform generates an average read length of 450â500 bp. We performed the sequencing with the B adapter (3â²âââ5â²) so that the complementarity determining region heavy 3 (CDRH3) region was proximal and the 5â² UTR was the sequencing primer, allowing higher sequencing quality in the majority of the IGHV coding region. Raw sequencing files are available in NCBI-SRA: BioProject ID: PRJNA302665; accession number: SAMN04277236-65., To overcome the limitation of working with unsorted IgG+ B cell subpopulations [antibody-secreting cells (ASC) or mB], we designed a computational protocol consisting of a second-order Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability of picking a progressive number of clonally related sequencing reads belonging to either population for each cell sampled, during the acute disease and post-convalescence [28]. The model accounts for individual variation over a gradient of relative proportions of ASC and mB cells, as well as cellular variation in the relative Ig transcription levels in both subpopulations. Briefly, the protocol calculates the probability of sampling Ig transcripts from either subpopulation by random sampling distributions corresponding to the relative amount of either subpopulation in a blood sample, as well as the relative amount of Ig transcripts per cell. The process is calculated in 500 individuals, for a given mB cell to ASC ratio that begins with 1 % of ASCs in post-convalescent individuals and ends with 1 % of mB cells (Additional file 1). In the simulation, an average of 1000 IgG+ B cells having a normal distribution and 5 % variance were randomly sampled. The Ig expression in mB cells has a normal distribution with a mean of 100 arbitrary units (au) and 5 % variance, and the Ig expression in ASCs follows a gamma distribution with central value of 1200 au (12-fold increase relative to an mB cell), a minimal value of 300, and a maximal value of 10,000 au [29] (Additional file 1)., We have developed a software (pipeline) named ImmunediveRsity for the analysis of the repertoire sequencing (Rep-Seq) data [30]. ImmunediveRsity is written in R language [31] and automates Ig sequencing analysis from pre-processing, error correction and quality filtering, V(D)J segment assignment, CDRH3-based sequence clustering for heavy chain clonotypes, and their further clustering into heavy chain lineages as a result of clonotype diversification by SHM (referred hereafter as clonotypes and lineages, respectively. Additional file 2). Raw sequences with an averageââ¥âQ28 value and reads â¥250 bp passed the quality filter. In order to exclude non-VH sequences, ImmunediveRsity assigns IGHV and IGHJ segment use to each read using IgBLAST [32]. A clonotype is composed by reads that share the same V and J segment and their CDRH3 has the same length and is 97 % identical [30]. To discard a possible effect of a CDRH3 clustering threshold on SHM, repertoire data are also reconstructed at a 92 % identity threshold. Reads belonging to a clonotype are further clustered along the whole coding region, excluding the signal peptide, so that the lineage is the consensus of reads sharing 99.5 % identity (Additional file 2). For the analysis of IGHV usage, collapsing sequences according to a common clonal origin and to a particular lineage allows the frequency to be expressed according to total clonotypes or lineages, regardless of Ig transcription levels. Thus, a given clonotype composed of 80 % of the sequencing reads has an equal clonotype frequency to that of a clonotype composed of 0.1 % of the sequenced reads. The same applies for lineages. For ImmunediveRsity, a lineage is an approximation of a single B cell, although it is possible to underestimate the true B cell numbers (for example, when two B cells from the same clonotype are identical or the proportion of SHM is below the clustering threshold of 99.5 % identity). ImmunediveRsity output files for each sequenced library can be found at http://â201.â131.â57.â23:â8080/âdengue-project-2015/â., 
                           ImmunediveRsity calculates clonotype and lineage entropy values (Shannon Index) [33, 34] and performs a rarefaction analysis [35] as indirect measures of lymphocyte diversity. The number of reads per clonotype and lineage obtained for each sample (acute or post-convalescent phase) was used to calculate the Shannon Index. Rarefaction curves were calculated with the number of clonotypes in growing subsamples of 1000 reads., We used three approaches to identify overrepresented IGHV segments during acute DENV infection. The first approach aimed to reflect IGHV use based on the estimation of IGHV segment relative transcription levels, regardless of clonotype and lineage composition, and was calculated based on the proportion of reads for each IGHV family and segments normalized to the total number of reads per library (raw IGHV usage). When both acute and post-convalescent samples were available, the proportion of reads for each segment during the acute (A) phase was subtracted from its corresponding value during the post-convalescent (Pc) phase (ÎAâPc). The second and third approaches aimed to estimate IGHV usage per clonotype or lineage, respectively, where the number of clonotypes or lineages using a particular IGHV segment was expressed as the proportion of all clonotypes or lineages in the corresponding library using a particular IGHV segment. Similar to the first approach, changes of IGHV usage are expressed as the difference of the acute phase frequency minus its corresponding post-convalescent frequency (ÎAâââPc). Statistical evaluation was done with a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing using Graph Pad Prism v5.0. Differences were considered statistically significant if pâ<â0.05., The numbers of non-synonymous and synonymous mutations were obtained with IMGT/HighVQuest [36] for each lineage consensus. To compare the proportion of mutations, only productive lineages were used for random sub-sampling (1280 lineages per library, which corresponded to the library with the least number of lineages). The proportion of mutations (pM-VH), proportion of non-synonymous mutations, and the proportion of synonymous mutations were calculated as the percentage of total mutations in the VH region, excluding the CDRH3, divided by its length. To avoid non-independence effects from lineages derived from large clonotypes, SHM was also calculated in the largest lineage per clonotype from 250 randomly sampled clonotypes. To identify differences in the proportion of mutations per IGHV segment, the mean global mutation proportion was subtracted from each individual IGHV mean mutation proportion. The difference was used for unsupervised hierarchical clustering according to IGHV segment using an uncentered correlation metric for clustering with CLUSTER 3.0 [37]. We performed multivariate comparisons among control, DWSâ A, DWS+ A, DWSâ Pc, and DWS+ Pc consensus of lineages based on different metrics including the mean of the proportion of mutations (non-synonymous and synonymous), the mean frequency of lineages, and CDRH3 length. A multilevel principal component analysis [38] was applied in a sample of 1280 randomly chosen lineages for each individual, and graphically visualized using biplot graph, which is a graphical representation of principal component 1 (PC1) versus principal component 2 (PC2), which are selected by the proportion of explained variance (that is, accounting for as much of the variability in the data as possible). This analysis was conducted using R software [39]. Non-parametric analyses (KruskalâWallis test) with Dunnâs correction for multiple testing were performed for comparisons among the different groups with R software [40]. Differences were considered statistically significant if pâ<â0.05., CDRH3 convergent signatures have been described in acute DENV infection [41]. We used two approaches to identify CDRH3 convergent signatures: the first was based on searching for the previously described signatures in our VH clonotype databases in acute infection and post-convalescence. The second was based on de novo identification of shared CDRH3 within our datasets. For both approaches, the R function Find_CDR3 of ImmunediveRsity was used [30]., In order to characterize the impact of acute DENV infection in the human B cell repertoire in terms of clinical status (DWSâ and DWS+) and immune status (primary and secondary infection), we sampled peripheral blood from 19 patients with laboratory-confirmed DENV infection during their febrile stage (DWSâ A, nâ=â10; DWS+ A, nâ=â9). No differences in the number of days after onset of symptoms were found regarding clinical (DWSâ or DWS+) (Additional file 3, Table 1) or immune status. As a reference, a second sample was obtained from some individuals 6 months after the first sample (post-convalescence) (DWSâ Pcâ=â7, DWS+ Pcâ=â4) (Fig. 1a, b). Socio-demographic and clinical data are summarized in Table 1. Of the 19 patients, only three had a primary infection (15.8 %) during the acute stage and the rest had secondary infections (84.2 %). All primary cases were classified as DWSâ. The predominant infecting serotype was DENV2 (10/19; 52.6 %), followed by DENV1 (7/19; 36.8 %). We could not determine the serotype in four patients (21.0 %) (Table 1). Sera from 15 individuals (78.9 %) presented high titers of cross-neutralizing antibodies to the four DENV serotypes, as measured by DENV reporter particle neutralization assay [26]; one individual showed cross-reactive titers to three DENV serotypes; and, as expected, the three patients with primary infections showed homotypic neutralization (Fig. 1c, Additional file 4). Owing to the high cross-reactivity among DENV serotypes, it was not possible to identify which was the primary infecting serotype in secondary cases.Table 1

                      , Thirty VH region IgG+ cDNA libraries of peripheral blood B cells were generated using a generic IgHG CH1-coding exon-specific antisense oligonucleotide for 5â²RACE-PCR amplification. A total of 2,364,822 raw and 2,044,447 pass-filter 454-Roche sequences were generated [27]. Pass filter reads were used as the input for ImmunediveRsity [30], which reconstructed 385,206 heavy chain lineages derived from 146,565 heavy chain clonotypes. The average number of lineages and clonotypes per patient was 11,553 (Â±6587) and 4420 (Â±2961), respectively (Table 2, Additional file 5). During acute dengue infection, there is a massive mobilization of plasmablasts to peripheral blood [42], and we identified a higher number IgG lineages during acute dengue infection (Fig. 2). Rarefaction analyses for clonotypes and entropy measurements were consistent with a higher number of IgG B cells during acute infection (Additional file 6). Given that the source of the sequenced material was RNA, these results imply that the sequenced lineages either had higher IgG expression (i.e., plasma cells and plasmablasts) or were clonally expanded.Table 2

                      , Results from the Monte Carlo simulation showed that the probability of sampling an mB cell lineage larger than 5 reads drops rapidly when the mB to ASC ratio drops below 9:1 (Fig. 3a, Additional file 1). Because the actual number of ASC and mB cells in our samples is unknown, we estimated the probability of sampling an IgG+ mB based on the previously described average IgG+ plasmablast count (56 %) during acute dengue infection (approximately 5.6 % of CD19+ B cells). Using these parameters, the probability of sampling a single read from an mB cell lineage was 0.015 and decreased for larger clonotypes (Fig. 3b. Additional file 1). However, even with a modest plasmablast increase to a proportion of 10 % (mB to ASC ratio of 9:1, or 1 % of CD19+ B cells), the probability of sampling an mB cell lineage larger than 5 reads was <0.04 (Fig. 3a, Additional file 1).

The probability of sampling an mB cell of a given size (number of reads per lineage) was calculated as described in Additional file 1. a Probability of sampling an mB cell of a given lineage size (read number) as a function of the proportion of mB cells in the sample (x axis). b Simulation of a dengue infection where plasmablast mobilization increases to 56 % of IgG+ B cells (or ~5.6 % of CD19+), with a concomitant reduction in the relative proportion of mB cells to 44 %. c Simulation of post-convalescence where the proportion of plasmablasts returns to basal levels (4.3 % of IgG+) and mBs dominate the sample. In these conditions, only very large lineages (â¥10 reads) are expected to derive from ASCs
                      , This scenario changes substantially in the post-convalescent phase, where the predominant IgG-expressing B cells are mB (average 95.8 %) [43, 44]. Under these conditions, sampling one read derived from an mB cell is common (pâ=â0.64) and its probability decreases below 0.012 until a lineage size threshold of 10 reads or higher is reached (Fig. 3c). The results of Monte Carlo simulation indicated that in patients with acute dengue, the majority of sequencing reads and the resulting lineages derived from ASCs. In contrast, during post-convalescence, lineages above 10 reads mainly derived from ASCs. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that in patients sampled at early-symptom onset, the proportion of ASCs may be similar to those sampled during the post-convalescent phase., A predominant use of certain IGHV families and segments in plasmablast-derived anti-DENV antibodies has been described [16]. Relative IGHV usage frequencies are expected to be heavily influenced by IgG transcription levels according to B cell functional stage. Thus, to compare relative IGHV family and segment usage, we analyzed IGHV family and segment usage per lineage (Fig. 4a, b), and per clonotype (Additional file 7), as well as IGHV family-relative and segment-relative transcription (based on read count, regardless of clonotype or lineage composition) (Additional file 7A, B). To identify a potential bias in IGHV use during acute DENV infection, we measured the difference between the relative frequencies of each IGHV family or segment during the acute phase minus the corresponding post-convalescent phase (ÎAâââPc). Interestingly, hierarchical clustering of ÎAâââPc IGHV usage per lineage revealed two patient clusters: one that showed increased IGHV3 and decreased IGHV1 family usage, containing all patients with primary infections and two with DWSâ with secondary infections; and the other showing increased IGHV1 and decreased IGHV3 family usage, containing the rest of the patients with secondary infections including all DWS+ patients (Fig. 4a). IGHV1 and IGHV3 usage was different between DWSâ and DWS+ (two-way ANOVA; pâ<â0.01 and pâ<â0.001, respectively).

Upper rows classify patients according to clinical status (DWSâ green and DWS+ blue) and immune status (primary orange and secondary purple) (two-way ANOVA, Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, *pâ<â0.05). b Difference between acute minus post-convalescent (ÎAâââPc) according to IGHV segment, clinical status, and immune status.

A higher frequency of lineages using IGHV1-18 and IGHV1-69 in DWS+ is shown in red tones. DWSâ dengue without warning signs; DWS+ dengue with warning signs; NA not applicable
                      , To identify the IGHV segments responsible for such differences, ÎAâââPc IGHV segment usage was compared. This revealed a significant increase in IGHV1-2 (two-way ANOVA, pâ<â0.01) and IGHV1-69 (two-way ANOVA, pâ<â0.001) usage frequency in acute DWS+ (Fig. 4b, Table 3). Further analysis of differential IGHV family or segment usage according to clonotypes consistently revealed that IGHV1-69 was significantly increased during acute DWS+ (two-way ANOVA, pâ<â0.001). One additional segment belonging to the IGHV1 family, IGHV1-18, was also significantly increased during acute DWSâ but not DWS+ (two-way ANOVA, pâ<â0.05) (Table 3, Additional file 7C).Table 3

                    , The estimation of IGHV usage has limitations because it is based on a comparison between a predominantly DENV-specific plasmablast repertoire (Fig. 3b) [42], with the repertoire of a mixed IgG+ non-DENV-specific mB cell and plasmablast population during the post-convalescent phase (Fig. 3c). We estimated that during the post-convalescent phase, the probability of sampling an mB cell containing 30 reads or higher was very low (â¤2.06447Eâââ06). To compare IGHV usage in plasmablasts during the acute and post-convalescent phases, we filtered out lineages below 30 reads, yielding similar results to those in the bulk analysis, but adding IGHV2-5 as significantly overrepresented (ANOVA pâ<â0.001) during the acute phase. Table 3 summarizes the analysis of differential IGHV family/segment usage in terms of the level of aggregation (lineages, clonotypes, relative expression, and filtering according to lineage size) and of differences between clinical and immune status. Because this analysis was performed using unsorted B cell populations, it is not possible to know the exact number of B cells involved. However, these results suggest a potential selection bias by DENV of B cells using segments of the IGHV1 family, particularly IGHV1-2, IGHV1-18, and IGHV1-69. Although IGHV1-2 raw expression was significantly increased in acute DWS+ (Additional file 7B; two-way ANOVA, pâ<â0.05), no differences were found at the clonotypic frequency level (Additional file 7C). Such differences in relative IGHV transcription (raw IGHV usage) may imply different proportions of cells with high IgG versus low IgG transcription, and not differences in the number of B cells using a particular IGHV segment. Biased usage of particular IGHV segments in response to a common pathogen in different individuals suggests that recognition is highly influenced by VH regions other than CDRH3 [45]. Thus, the composition of such biased IGHV expansions should be polyclonal. Indeed, digital CDRH3 âspectra-typingâ for biased IGHV segments at the lineage level confirmed this to be the case (Additional file 8)., To address if allelic variation in IGHV segment could influence the expansion of particular IGHV segments, we characterized the IGHV genotypes for IGHV1-2, IGHV1-18, and IGHV1-69 (Additional file 9). We found no correlation between allele type and expansion in the corresponding IGHV segments., A hallmark of the adaptive humoral immune response is affinity maturation as a result of antigen re-exposure. Affinity maturation occurs by SHM and mainly affects antigen-selected GC B cells [12]. SHM is mechanistically coupled with CSR [46]. Given that the majority of the samples analyzed in this study focused on the IgG compartment from secondary infections (class switched B cells), higher levels of SHM in B cells would be expected. In order to detect whether higher levels of SHM had indeed occurred, the percentage of mutations in the IGHV, using the germ-line as reference segments, was calculated for each consensus of lineages [36]. We observed that acute DENV infection had an overall lower proportion of SHM than the corresponding level during post-convalescence, regardless of the clinical (Fig. 5a) or immune status (Fig. 5b). This effect was different from that observed in the 2008â2009 trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV), in which the proportion of SHM at 7 days post-vaccination increased (Fig. 5a) [23]. Interestingly, SHM levels were significantly lower in DWS+ than in DWSâ, and in secondary than in primary DENV infection (Fig. 5b). Moreover, among acute secondary cases, lower SHM levels were found in DWS+ than in DWSâ (Fig. 5a). SHM is the basis for selection of high-affinity antibodies [12]; nevertheless, calculation of non-synonymous mutations yielded the same results as overall mutation rates (Additional file 10).

                        IgG B cell repertoire during acute DENV infection is associated with low somatic hypermutation (SHM) rates. SHM rates are shown according to clinical status (a) and according to immune status (b), measured as the proportion of mutations along the VH region [pM-VH (%)]. a The global SHM rate during the acute phase is significantly lower in acute DENV infection, but not as a result of the 2008â2009 seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccination (TVI). b Global SHM rates are lower in the acute phase of DENV infection and significantly lower in acute secondary infection than in acute primary infection.

                      , In mice, marginal zone (MZ) B cell subsets are less dependent on T cell help, can be class-switched to IgG, have lower SHM rates, and have a differential IGHV usage [47], suggesting that in human DENV infection, the participation of a particular IgG+ B cell subset using unmutated or poorly mutated IGHV segments may take place. To determine if the reduction of SHM particularly affected certain IGHV segments during acute DENV infection, we calculated SHM rates according to IGHV segment. Significantly lower levels of SHM during acute DENV infection compared to post-convalescence were observed for IGHV1-2, IGHV1-18, and IGHV1-69 (pâ<â0.001) (Additional file 11). As for the total repertoire, significantly lower levels of SHM of IGHV1-2 were observed in acute DWS+ compared to acute DWSâ (pâ<â0.001) and in acute secondary versus acute primary infections (Additional file 11A, B). In the case of IGHV1-18 and IGHV1-69, acute secondary infection had significantly lower SHM levels than acute primary infection (Additional file 11DâF); however, no significant differences were observed between acute DWS+ and DWSâ (Additional file 11)., Regarding IGHV overrepresentation analysis, to avoid comparing SHM levels in a mainly DENV-specific plasmablast repertoire during the acute phase with a mixed non-DENV-specific plasmablast and non-DENV-specific mB cell repertoire during the post-convalescent phase, we filtered out all lineages with fewer than 30 reads (Additional file 1). Thus, we compared the proportion of SHM in DENV-specific plasmablasts during the acute disease with non-DENV-specific plasmablasts during the post-convalescent phase. The SHM levels were significantly lower during the acute phase, although there was no significant difference in IGHV1-2 SHM levels in DWSâ patients (Fig. 6).

As a result of Monte Carlo simulation, we estimated that it was very unlikely for samples to have a memory B (mB) lineage larger than 30 reads during post-convalescence (pâ=â2.0645Eâââ06). The SHM rates were recalculated in in silico-sorted ASCs during post-convalescence, and classified according to clinical status. a Global SHM levels. b SHM in lineages using IGHV1-2. c SHM in lineages using IGHV1-18. d SHM in lineages using IGHV1-69.

                      , To avoid potential non-independence effects imposed by sampling clonally related lineages, we also performed the same SHM estimation but instead of random lineage subsampling in each library, we randomly subsampled 250 clonotypes and performed the SHM analysis in the corresponding largest lineage. The results using this approach agreed with the lower SHM rates in the bulk analysis, indicating that our SHM estimates were not the result of sampling bias (Additional file 12)., Moreover, to discard the possibility that clonotype (CDRH3) clustering threshold identity (97 %) could artificially sub-estimate SHM levels, we performed an analysis with the reconstructed repertoire at a CDRH3 threshold identity of 92 %. Under these parameters, SHM levels were equally low during the acute phase (Additional file 13)., As shown in Figs 5 and 6a, global SHM rates were lower in acute DENV infection, suggesting that this effect is not restricted to only IGHV1-2, IGHV1-18, and IGHV1-69. Calculation of SHM rates for all IGHV segments during acute and post-convalescent DENV infection and for controls (subjected to hierarchical clustering according to IGHV segment) revealed significantly higher SHM rates in controls and post-convalescent individuals than in patients with acute DENV infection (MannâWhitney U test, pâ<â0.001) (Additional file 14)., Because the number of lineages belonging to a given B cell clonotype is the result of SHM, a straightforward prediction derived from lower SHM rates is that the number of lineages per heavy chain clonotype during the acute phase of DENV infection will also be low. Consistent with our observations, the clonotype per lineage ratio (1/lineages) was significantly reduced during the acute phase of DENV infection in both DWS+ and DWSâ (KruskalâWallis test, Dunnâs correction, pâ<â0.001)., Finally, we performed a multivariate analysis based on multilevel principal component analysis to search for association patterns between SHM rates, clonal selection (lineage relative frequency), and clinical condition. We used the mean proportion (%) of all mutations, non-synonymous and synonymous mutations in the IGHV segment, as well as the mean relative frequency of 1280 randomly chosen lineages as variables for the analysis. CDRH3 length was excluded because it did not contribute significantly to variance. Two components, PC1 and PC2 explained 76.3 % and 22.6 % of the variance, respectively, with a cumulative proportion of 98.9 %. Mean PC1 score was significantly different between acute DWS+ and post-convalescence (pâ<â0.01) (Fig. 7a). Although PC1 was lower in acute DWSâ than in post-convalescence, no significant differences were found. However, PC1 was significantly lower in DWSâ and DWS+ than in the healthy control group (pâ<â0.05 and pâ<â0.01, respectively). Bi-plots of PC1 and PC2 showed four major clusters, one containing the majority of the healthy control samples, a second containing DWS+, a third containing most of the DWSâ sample, and a fourth containing most of the post-convalescent patients, regardless of clinical status during acute disease (Fig. 7b). Taken together, mutation analysis using supervised and non-supervised approaches robustly supports that circulating IgG+ B cells during acute DENV infection were less hypermutated than IgG+ B cells in the post-convalescent phase or in healthy controls.

                      , Convergent antibody signatures in different individuals responding to a variety of viral infections (reviewed in [48]), including dengue virus infection, have been described [41]. We used as a query a dataset of 151 convergent CDRH3s [41] to search for near-identical matches (one mismatch tolerance) or identical matches on our acute or post-convalescent databases. We found 1098 shared CDRH3 in at least three individuals during acute infection (19 cases) versus 53 shared CDRH3 in at least three post-convalescent individuals (10 cases). Correcting for differences in the total number of clonotypes, 3.6 % of clonotypes were shared in at least three individuals during acute infection compared to 0.44 % during post-convalescence (8.3-fold difference) (Fig. 8a). A similar approach searching for identical CDRH3s revealed that 0.23 % of clonotypes (68) were shared in at least three individuals during acute infection compared to 0.03 % (3) during post-convalescence (9.1-fold difference) (Fig. 8a). Only three convergent CDRH3s were found in no more than two individuals of a group of healthy individuals prior to vaccination with TIV (Fig. 5a).

                      , We also searched for convergent CDRH3s regardless of their presence in the dataset described in [41] (de novo). We found 1365 clonotypes representing 269 identical CDRH3s shared in at least three individuals during acute infection (0.9 % of all clonotypes in acute infection). Interestingly, among shared clonotypes there was a predominant CDRH3 length of 10 residues (70 %) (Fig. 8bâe). Two CDRH3s, ARQFGNWFDS and ARQWGNWFDL, were shared in 10 individuals (10/19, 52 % of individuals) (Fig. 8e). A CDRH3, ARQLGNWFDS, present in nine individuals was similar, although not identical to, the ARQIGNWFDP signature described in [41] (differences in italics). Finally, we addressed whether the convergent heavy chain clonotypes were less hypermutated. We sampled the largest lineage of convergent and non-convergent VH clonotypes as in Additional file 12. As expected, lower SHM rates were found in convergent VH lineages (Fig. 8f)., Understanding of the immune response to DENV infection has been hampered by the lack of adequate experimental models [49], but represents an urgent goal for developing safe vaccination strategies and as the basis for understanding the role of population immunity in disease transmission dynamics [50]. Using an IgG Rep-Seq approach, we have shown that in the course of an acute DENV infection there is an increase in B cell clonal diversity in peripheral blood, presumably as a result of DENV-specific plasmablast mobilization. We also documented differences in the relative frequencies of B cells using certain IGHV segments belonging to the IGHV1 family according to clinical status. More importantly, we found a paradoxically low SHM frequency in the acute phase, as compared to the corresponding post-convalescent phase. Also paradoxical is the fact that the SHM frequency was even lower in secondary than in primary DENV infections. Interestingly, for some IGHV segments such as IGHV1-2, the SHM rates were lower in DWS+ compared to DWSâ infection., HTS of the B cell repertoire has been applied to explore higher order structural properties of the antibody repertoire [35, 51], track leukemia residual disease [52], uncover clonal lineages and patterns of SHM profiles in broadly neutralizing antibodies in human immunodeficiency virus [53], as well as to analyze the antibody response in influenza virus infection [54] and vaccination [23, 55, 56]. It is particularly relevant for the work presented here to explore convergent antibody signatures in DENV infection [41]. Being a relatively recently developed approach, there are substantial methodological and analytical differences by which the research groups have coped with the challenge of mining the lymphocyte repertoire complexity. An important methodological difference is whether the starting material for Ig sequencing is DNA or RNA. Sequencing DNA has the advantage of providing a single copy per B cell as template for PCR amplification, thus, assuming unbiased PCR amplification, the clonal size is a reflection of the number of clonally related B cells in a given clone. An important advantage of using RNA-derived libraries for sequencing, particularly those generated by 5â²RACE-PCR, is that less PCR amplification bias is expected owing to the use of a single primer pair based on invariant amplicon flanks [20]. However, in contrast to DNA sequencing, differences in B-cell receptor (BCR) expression related to differentiation stage hamper an accurate estimation of clonal composition and size. To cope with potential distortions of Ig expression levels derived from unsorted B cells, we collapsed sequencing reads according to common clonal origin (heavy chain clonotypes) or further into lineages (consensus of sequences from a common clonal origin displaying a differential SHM pattern). Using this approach, IGHV frequency usage and SHM levels were quantified with respect to the corresponding denominator, reducing biases related to Ig expression levels., In the context of DENV infection, we used the absolute lineage number, rarefaction analysis, and ShannonâWeaver index (entropy) as an approximation to estimate diversity in a subsample B cell repertoire (Fig. 2, Additional file 6). These analyses suggest that during acute DENV infection there is an increase in B cell diversity. An increase in B cell clonality due to clonal expansion using P[collision] was recently described [41]. We argue that our results are not contradictory to this; P[collision] is estimated by replicate sampling and measures the probability of finding clonally related B cells in the replicates. Thus, clonal expansions can be readily assessed and proved during the acute phase of DENV infection [41]. Here, because we used RNA as the starting material and sequenced a unique sample, we cannot evaluate clonal expansion directly (because clonally related sequences may be clustered during the reconstruction of clonotypes and lineages). Nevertheless, we interpret the higher species richness in rarefaction analysis and the increased ShannonâWeaver index as the result of higher numbers of circulating B cells, which could be explained, at least partially, by the massive plasmablast migration that occurs during the acute phase of the disease [15, 19, 42, 57]., Preferential IGHV usage has been described in antigen-specific B cells in models of cytopathic viral infection. In vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection in mice, a rapid initial IgG-neutralizing response of defined germline unmutated IGHV segments (VHQ52) confer protection. Secondary challenge is associated with a shift in the use of other segments (VH7183 and VHJ558) and the occurrence of SHM [58, 59]., The generation of unmutated IgG+-switched mB cells beyond the VSV model has been described in a model of Polyomavirus infection [60] in Bcl6-deficient mice, which are devoid of TFH cells and thus lack a GC reaction [61, 62]. Also in mice, an extrafollicular response to Salmonella with sufficiently low levels of SHM to promote affinity maturation was recently described [63]. Strikingly similar results have been obtained in human Rotavirus infection, where the response to VP6 is mediated in part by class-switched mB cells exhibiting low hypermutation rates that predominantly use IGHV1-46 [64]. These observations have been generalized as part of the concept of ânatural antibodies,â which can be IgM, IgG, and IgA. These are encoded by unmutated germline antibody genes, are produced as a rapid T cell-independent response against a variety of viruses with relatively high affinity, and recognize repetitive structures such as viral capsids, but are intrinsically poly-reactive [65]. A notable example of this type are IGHV1-69-coded antibodies that have been recurrently implicated in recognition against influenza A, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency viruses [45, 48, 66â70]., In accordance with a natural antibody response, DENV activates poly-reactive, natural IgG B cells after primary and secondary infection [15]. Studies with human anti-DENV monoclonal antibodies have revealed that a large proportion of DENV-reactive human antibodies are highly cross-reactive [17, 18] and recognize quaternary epitopes present only on the viral particle, but not in monomeric E protein [71]. Here we found low levels of SHM and differential usage of IGHV1-2, IGHV1-18, and IGHV1-69 in acute DWSâ and DWS+, suggesting their potential implication in natural DENV recognition, cross-reactivity, and antibody-dependent enhancement. The 5â²RACE-PCR approach used for VH library generation rules out a possible bias for amplification of unmutated over hypermutated sequences. We propose that during acute primary and secondary DENV infections, at least two effector B cell differentiation pathways co-occur, one consisting of a natural poorly mutated antibody IgG response (similar to that occurring in the VSV infection model and Polyomavirus infections in mice and Rotavirus infections in humans), and the other of a classic secondary T cell- and GC-dependent B cell response pathway (Fig. 9). Although the relative contribution of both pathways to SHM levels in peripheral IgG+ B cells is difficult to assess, the presented evidence suggests that the GC-i response is strong enough to significantly influence the levels of SHM.
                    Fig. 9
                      Proposed model for B cell responses in secondary lymphoid organs during DENV infection. DENV recognition by naÃ¯ve B cells and during early primary infection occurs in extra-follicular regions and induces a rapid differentiation to Ig-switched antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) secreting unmutated poly/cross-reactive IgG. This pathway may be initiated by DENV low-affinity interactions with B cells using an âinnateâ IGHV segment such as IGHV1-69 [70] that promotes receptor-mediated endocytosis and TLR7 recognition. Both signals promote T-independent activation and class switch recombination (CSR). Later, the classical germinal center T-dependent response develops, peaking 1â2 weeks after symptoms onset. A secondary infection with a different serotype triggers the same ânaturalâ B cell response derived from naÃ¯ve B cells that temporally overlaps with a more rapid secondary T-dependent B cell response
                    , Interestingly, lower IgG SHM rates were found in acute disease, and appeared to be more accentuated in DWS+ than in DWSâ, and in secondary more than in primary acute infections. This effect was particularly clear in IGHV1-2-expressing IgG B cells. Consistent with its role in natural antibody recognition, IGHV1-2 is frequently used by neonatal cord blood IgM+ lymphocytes [72] and in MZ B cell lymphomas [73, 74], which are thought to derive from chronic pathogen-mediated selection [75]. MZ B cells are capable of mounting class-switched and class-unswitched T-independent as well as T-dependent B cell responses [47]. Normal MZ B cells produce rapid responses to blood-borne pathogens and could be the source of natural IgM and IgG responses against DENV. However, no modification in MZ B cells was observed in children with acute DENV infection [19]. Moreover, human MZ B cells are usually hypermutated [47], thus suggesting that during acute DENV infection, MZ B cells are not the source of circulating poorly mutated IgG+ B cells., Among other limitations of the HTS approach is that our VH libraries derived from total peripheral blood IgG-expressing B cells; as such, we have no information regarding the relative contribution of different B cell subsets or their antigen specificity. However, in support of our results, a preferential use of the IGHV1 family in plasmablasts, but not mB cells, has been described in acute DENV infection [16]. Moreover, the high proportion of DENV-specific plasmablasts occurring during acute infection [42] provides further support to the claim that the observed repertoire differences may be DENV-specific as well., Another limitation of working with unsorted IgG+ B cells, namely mB cells and ASCs (plasmablasts and plasma cells) is that their relative proportions vary dramatically during acute dengue infection, making it difficult to compare their respective repertoires. We used a Monte Carlo simulation method to estimate the probability of sampling either subpopulation depending on the relative proportions of mB cells and ASCs. A limitation of this simulation is that it cannot discriminate ASC from mB cells that have proliferated extensively. However, the lack of variation in the proportion of mB cells in acute dengue argues against this possibility [19, 57]. Interestingly, we estimated that the probability of sampling mB cells during acute dengue is negligible owing to the large number of plasmablasts and their corresponding high Ig expression levels. Likewise, during the post-convalescence phase, the probability of sampling an mB cell larger than 30 reads is negligible as well. This approach allowed us to partition the repertoire according to Ig expression level and to confirm our observations regarding IGHV usage and SHM level differences during acute disease. These experiments also highlight an additional advantage of using 5â²RACE-PCR for Rep-Seq., We are beginning to elucidate the molecular basis for T-independent CSR to IgG. In mice, TLR7 and TLR9 synergize with BCR signaling to promote activation-induced cytidine deaminase expression, which is required for CSR and SHM [76]. Although both processes are functionally coupled, it is not clear how SHM is prevented in B cells undergoing T-independent CSR. TLR-mediated signaling pathways are implicated in promoting T-independent CSR [76] and T-independent IgG responses against Polyomavirus require MyD88 [77]. Endosomal DENV recognition by TLR7 could provide a synergic signal with the BCR for T-independent CSR anti-DENV cross-reactive B cells (Fig. 9)., The proposed model of extra-follicular B cell responses offers a potential explanation for the production of low-affinity sub-neutralizing and cross-reactive IgG antibodies that may promote disease enhancement. Thus, in the case of DENV vaccination and analogously to observations in Polyomavirus-immunized mice [60], strategies that promote T-independent B cell responses (i.e., TLR7 agonist) could be associated with a higher risk of severe disease upon reinfection than strategies that do not [78, 79]., Our results in B cell repertoire mining suggest that during acute dengue infection, in parallel with a GC-dependent pathway, a GC-independent effector differentiation pathway may occur, which manifests as preferential IGHV gene use and low SHM in IgG class-switched B cells. This non-GC pathway may not be restricted to primary infections, given that SHM levels were even lower in secondary acute infections and was more striking in acute DWS+. Further research is required to obtain definitive proof of a GC-independent B cell differentiation in response to dengue infection, as well as to define the role of poorly mutated IgG in terms of poly-reactivity and ADE. Nevertheless, our findings are relevant for understanding of the immune response to DENV and future vaccine development., antibody-dependent enhancement, analysis of variance, antibody-secreting cell, B cell receptor, complementarity determining region heavy 3, class switch recombination, Dengue virus, dengue without warning sings, dengue with warning sings, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, germinal center, high-throughput sequencing, memory B cell, principal component, proportion of mutations in VH region, rapid amplification of cDNA ends, Repertoire Sequencing, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, reporter virus particles, somatic hypermutation, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, vesicular stomatitis virus,

                                          . Raw IgG HTS data was subjected to repertoire reconstruction and analysis using ImmunediveRsity. Briefly, ImmunediveRsity assigns IGHV gene to each sequence and clusters them according to IGH clonotypes, which are composed of reads with the same IGHV-IGHJ rearrangement and quasi-identical CDRH3 (â¥97 % identity at the nucleotide level). Within a clonotype, one or more lineages can be defined based on SHM pattern (99.5 % identity). IGHV usage frequency can thus be expressed as the proportion of reads using a particular IGHV segment (relative transcription), regardless of clonotype origin, or can be expressed as the proportion of IGH clonotypes or lineages using a particular IGHV segment regarding the total amount of clonotypes or lineages, respectively.

                Background
                Disease risk assessments based on common genetic variation have gained widespread attention and use in recent years. The clinical utility of genetic risk profiles depends on the number and effect size of identified loci, and how stable the predicted risks are as additional loci are discovered. Changes in risk classification for individuals over time would undermine the validity of common genetic variation for risk prediction. In this analysis, we quantified reclassification of genetic risk based on past and anticipated future GWAS data.
              
                Methods
                We identified disease-associated SNPs via the NHGRI GWAS catalog and recent large scale genome-wide association study (GWAS). We calculated the genomic risk for a simulated cohort of 100,000 individuals based on a multiplicative odds ratio model using cumulative GWAS-identified SNPs at four time points: 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013. Individuals were classified as Higher Risk (population adjusted odds >2), Average Risk (between 0.5 and 2), and Lower Risk (<0.5) for each time point and we compared classifications between time points for breast cancer (BrCa), prostate cancer (PrCa), diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2D), and cardiovascular heart disease (CHD). We estimated future reclassification using the anticipated number of undiscovered SNPs.
              
                Results
                Risk reclassification occurred for all four phenotypes from 2007 to 2013. During the most recent interval (2011-2013), the degree of risk reclassification ranged from 16.3 % for CHD to 24.4 % for PrCa. Many individuals classified as Higher Risk at earlier time points were subsequently reclassified into a lower risk category. From 2011 to 2013, the degree of such downward risk reclassification ranged from 24.9 % for T2D to 55 % for CHD. The percent of individuals classified as Higher Risk increased as more SNPs were discovered, ranging from an increase of 5 % for CHD to 9 % for PrCa from 2007 to 2013. Reclassification continued to occur when we modeled the discovery of anticipated SNPs based on doubling current sample size.
              
                Conclusion
                Risk estimates from common genetic variation show large reclassification rates. Identifying disease-associated SNPs facilitates the clinically relevant task of identifying higher-risk individuals. However, the large amount of reclassification that we demonstrated in individuals initially classified as Higher Risk but later as Average Risk or Lower Risk, suggests that caution is currently warranted in basing clinical decisions on common genetic variation for many complex diseases.

Identifying disease-associated SNPs facilitates the clinically relevant task of identifying higher-risk individuals. However, the large amount of reclassification that we demonstrated in individuals initially classified as Higher Risk but later as Average Risk or Lower Risk, suggests that caution is currently warranted in basing clinical decisions on common genetic variation for many complex diseases., Risk assessments for common, multifactorial disease based on common genetic variation have long been heralded as a potential clinical application of genomic data [1â6]. The possibility of informative disease risk prediction has gained widespread attention in recent years due to the thousands of disease risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Moreover, disease risk prediction based on genetic variation has become increasingly familiar in broader society in part due to the availability and marketing of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genomic testing products [7, 8]. While there are concerns about accurately estimating and communicating common complex risk information [9, 10], customers of DTC genetic testing services discuss their genetic testing results with their physicians and have follow-up testing related to their results [11, 12]. The FDAâs 2013 order to the DTC genomic testing company 23andMe is based in part on the concern that customers may inappropriately use their results to influence their use of medical services [13, 14]., A future role for using personal genetic variation in disease risk assessment continues to be of intense interest and efforts to optimize prediction models for many common medical problems continue. As the technical and cost barriers to whole genome sequencing have decreased significantly in recent years, the application of whole genome sequencing in patients with undiagnosed disorders is growing [15], the sequencing of healthy populations has begun to be explored, and disease risk assessment for common diseases has been demonstrated as a possible application of whole genome sequencing data [16, 17]. In the MedSeq Project, a randomized clinical trial exploring the integration of whole genome sequencing information in clinical care, we are exploring the strengths and limitations of current approaches to risk assessment from common genetic variation, with specific attention to clinical utility and interpretability, and developed a common genetic variant risk assessment for cardiovascular phenotypes [18, 19]., The predictive ability and resulting clinical utility of risk evaluation from common genetic variation depends on the number and effect size of the loci associated with the probability of developing a given phenotype, and has to date been found to generally be modest for most multifactorial conditions. Non-genetic factors such as diet and other exposures will also continue to be important predictors for multifactorial phenotypes such as diabetes. Nevertheless, identifying a subgroup of the population that is at high genetic risk offers clinically relevant opportunities such as enhanced screening or targeted lifestyle modification initiatives., Many questions remain concerning risk modeling, such as the ability of risk-associated SNPs to capture the genetic architecture for a phenotype and interactions between variants and epigenetic effects [20]. It is reasonable to assume, however, that as additional GWAS are undertaken and overall sample sizes increase, new risk-associated SNPs will be discovered and effect estimates of currently used SNPs will be modified. In addition to enabling novel disease pathway and therapeutic target identification, these SNPs will explain larger proportions of heritability for multifactorial conditions. The genetic component of predictive models will therefore improve and, depending on an individualâs genotype, risk predictions for a given individual will often change. The likelihood of large shifts in risk classification for any given individual as more disease-associated SNPs are identified is not known, however. Moreover, whether the potential for clinically meaningful change in risk assessment diminishes or increases has not been fully explored., The stability of predicted genetic risks as additional loci are discovered is therefore an important, largely unexplored factor. If genetic risk assessments for a given individual vary significantly over time as new loci are included in the predictive model for a specific condition, it could undermine the validity and utility of common genetic variation for risk prediction that is based upon early SNP discoveries. For example, if an EKG or even a cardiac stress test were ordered for an individual due to an increased genetic risk assessment of coronary heart disease, but subsequent additions of SNPs or effect modifications for existing SNPs in the model caused a reclassification of the individual to a lower risk category, the individual would have undergone unwarranted testing, with the associated unnecessary risk and cost. Conversely, if an individual were originally classified as Lower Risk for a condition and does not pursue standard screening tests or lifestyle modification due to the results, but subsequent identification of high-risk SNPs results in a reclassification to the Higher Risk group, then false reassurance from the initial results might result in missed opportunities for disease risk modification., A reclassification rate is the percentage of individuals who change predefined risk categories based on change in prediction model or over time. Past published efforts to explore the question of reclassification based on genetic risk predictions include a 2009 study that compared risk reclassification for diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2D) based on one SNP, an 18-SNP model, and the 18-SNP model in addition to non-genetic risk factors and found significant reclassification rates between the three models [21]. We are not aware, however, of updated or more comprehensive evaluations of genetic risk reclassification. The rapid and continuing expansion of the number of statistically significant SNPs in the literature and GWAS catalog offers an opportunity to assess risk reclassification both on recent data and using projected future data based on larger sample sizes. While reclassification rates should eventually diminish as more risk-associated SNPs are discovered, it is not clear if reclassification rates will stabilize, increase or decline in as the next waves of GWAS data are published., With our primary interest and focus on the near-future clinical applicability of risk prediction from common genetic variation, we analyze reclassification based on past, present, and future GWAS results using the NHGRI GWAS Catalog for four phenotypes [22]. We explore the impact of discovering new SNPs along with modification of effects sizes for four phenotypes: (1) breast cancer (BrCa); (2) prostate cancer (PrCa); (3) diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2D); and (4) coronary heart disease (CHD). We estimate reclassification and model predictive ability for these four phenotypes based on a simulated cohort of 100,000 individuals, first looking backwards at the risk prediction model for each phenotype from GWAS data since 2007. We then explore the impact on reclassification based on a hypothetical future GWAS with double the sample size of the most recent two-stage GWAS for each phenotype., To emulate the methods most widely used by DTC genomic companies and others, our risk prediction model for each phenotype uses SNPs that have been reported at genome-wide significance [10, 16, 23]. Though no best practice has been established for calculating disease risk from multiple risk alleles, we use the multiplicative odds ratio (OR) model in combining the SNPs for each phenotype (equivalent to additive log odds as described in Purcell et al.) [10, 19, 24]. To assess how risk prediction could change over time, we account for the continuing discovery of new SNPs and the change in effect size in time for previously identified SNPs., A SNP was considered associated with the disease of interest if the P value was less than the genome wide significant cutoff of 5âÃâ10-8. SNPs were identified from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) catalog [22] and supplemented by data from four recent large scale studies [25â28]. If one of the recent large-scale studies reported a position for a previously discovered SNP that was different from what was specified in the NHGRI catalog, it was set to the value in the NHGRI catalog. We examined four different diseases: breast cancer (BrCa), prostate cancer (PrCa), T2D, and coronary heart disease (CHD) at four different time points: the end of 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013. The 2009 risk calculations would therefore include the SNPs that had been reported 2009 or prior., We considered SNPs within 500 kb of each other to be at the same locus. We included SNPs at a locus in a stepwise fashion, starting with the SNP with the most significant P value at a given time point and then adding subsequent SNPs in order of significance if the r2 between the candidate SNP and all SNPs already included was below 0.75. Thresholds of 0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 were also considered to assess the sensitivity of the genetic risk distribution to pruning on different thresholds of LD. We retrieved LD info from the SNP Annotation and Proxy (SNAP) database [29]. Using r2 thresholds between 0.25 and 0.75 produced similar results. Using an r2 threshold of 1 (that is, include all SNPs at the locus) produced larger genetic risk gradients and area-under-the-curve (AUC) values, but likely overestimates the effect of each locus by double-counting the effect of causal variants tagged by multiple highly correlated SNPs. We adopted this procedure to mimic procedures that rely on catalogs of published GWAS results [17]; more accurate modeling of the contribution of multiple SNPs at a locus can be achieved though conditional or haplotype modeling., To assess the reclassification in genetic risk values, we estimated the distribution of genetic ORs in cases and in controls. We simulated a cohort of 100,000 individuals of European descent for each of the four conditions evaluated. Assuming the incidence of disease is rare, the distribution of genetic ORs in this cohort approximates the distribution of genetic relative risks in controls. (We repeated the calculations in Tables 3 and 5 explicitly using the distribution in controls for a range of disease incidences from near 0 to 10 %. Results did not appreciably vary from those presented here; differences were mostly under 1 %.) We simulated the genotype for all of the genome-wide significant SNPs discovered from 2007 to 2013, based on the number of SNPs present at each locus. The genotype of each locus was generated independently of other loci. If a locus consisted of one SNP, the genotype was simulated from a binomial distribution using allele frequencies from the 1000 Genomes or HapMap European cohorts, depending upon availability [30, 31]. When a locus contained more than one SNP, a two-fold approach was used. If phased data were available (HapMap or 1000 genomes), the genotype was then bootstrapped from the phased haplotypes for the 100,000 individuals. When phase data were not available, haplotype frequencies were estimated via the EM algorithm [32] and then diplotypes were simulated via a multinomial distribution. Regardless of availability of phase, we removed related individuals using the BioQ notation [33]., To analyze genetic risk values across over time, the genotypic ORs were simulated for SNPs that had been discovered by the four selected dates (2007, 2009, 2011, 2013) and the resulting SNPs were then pruned based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) (see above). The genetic OR for each simulated subject was calculated via a multiplicative model where:$$ Odd{s}_{i,m}={\displaystyle \prod_{j=1}^{k_m}}O{R}_{j,m}^{g_{i,j}} $$
                        , Here k
                           m
                   is the number of SNPs known to be associated with a disease at the time point m, and g
                           i,j
                   is the genotype for individual i at SNP j. If at a later time point a study reported a more significant P value for a SNP than had previously been reported, the OR was set to that reported value. The effect size of the SNP is thus allowed to change over time. Thus the ORj,m indicates the OR at time point m for SNP j. The odds were then normalized by the population mean from each simulated cohort.$$ {O}_{i,m}=\frac{Odd{s}_{i,m}}{\overline{Odd{s}_i,m}} $$
                        , The normalized OR represents the odds of disease for simulated individual i with genotype g
                           i
                  â=â(g
                           i1,â¦,.g

                  ) relative to the population average odds. While the exact formula used by DTC companies is unique to each company, the mathematical approach used by 23andMe and others is based on some version of the multiplicative odds model used in our study [10]., The cumulative distribution function for genetic ORs in cases is given by:$$ \Pr \left({O}_{g,m}\le k\right)={\displaystyle {\sum}_g{O}_{g,m} \Pr (g)1\left({O}_{g,m}\le k\right),} $$and in controls by:$$ \Pr \left({O}_{g,m}\le k\right)={\displaystyle {\sum}_g \Pr (g)1\left({O}_{g,m}\le k\right),} $$where Pr(g) is estimated using the distribution of genotypes in the simulated cohort. This calculation assumes the disease is rare so that the genetic OR approximates the genetic relative risk., Normalized odds were calculated for the simulated individuals using the known genome-wide significant SNPs known, and their associated ORs for common complex diseases, at four different time points: 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013. Individuals could be classified at three levels of risk: Lower Risk (Oi <0.5); Moderate Risk (0.5ââ¤âOiââ¤â2); and Higher Risk (Oiâ>â2) [34, 35]. The percent reclassification was calculated as the percentage of individuals on the off-diagonal of a 3âÃâ3 table classification table looking between time points. The net reclassification index was calculated as the proportion of cases whose reclassified risk category increased minus the proportion of cases whose reclassified risk category decreased, plus the proportion of controls whose reclassified risk category decreased minus the proportion of controls whose reclassified risk category increased. We chose these cutoffs not because they correspond to any specific clinical decision algorithm, but because they have been used previously as a general benchmark for whether genetic information provides potentially actionable information [35]., The AUC was also calculated at each time point as [36]:$$ \mathrm{A}\mathrm{U}\mathrm{C}=\upphi \left(\frac{\mathrm{a}}{\sqrt{1+{b}^2}}\right);a=\frac{\mu_D-{\mu}_{\overline{D}}}{\sigma_D};b=\frac{\sigma_{\overline{D}}}{\sigma_D} $$
                        , Where Ï is the cumulative distribution for a normal distribution and D represents the case population and \( \overline{D} \) represents the control population. The parameters are all in terms of the distribution of the log risks: \( {\mu}_{\overline{D}} \) = the mean log genetic OR in controls, \( {\sigma}_{\overline{D}} \) = the standard deviation of the log genetic OR in controls, and Î¼

                   and Ï
                           D
                   are the corresponding values for cases., We also estimated the total number of common SNPs that are potentially detectable by GWAS, given a large enough sample size. The number of causal SNPs was calculated via the âbinâ method described by Park et al. [37], which groups SNPs based on effect size eâ=âÎ²22q(1-q). Here Î² and q are the log OR and minor allele frequencies for a SNP, Mj is the number of SNPs observed in bin i; pj is the power to observe a SNP with effect size corresponding to bin j, given the largest sample size studied up to the time point [38]:$$ {M}_{T,j}=\frac{M_j}{p_j};{M}_{Total}={\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^k}{M}_{T,j} $$
                        , MT,j is thus the total estimated number of SNPs in that bin [37] and k is the number of disease-associated SNPs reported in the recent large-scale GWAS studies [25â28, 39]. To simplify power calculations, for this analysis we only used the SNPs reported in recent combined two-stage design studies [25â28, 39]. We are assuming in these calculations that the SNPs in these GWAS studies are the only SNPs that have been reported. Thus the total number of SNPs may be less than the amount reported above., In order to assess how much current estimates of risk will vary as a result of additional GWAS discoveries in the near future, we also explored how much reclassification would be observed for each phenotype using SNPs hypothetically discovered from a GWAS with double the sample size of the most recent GWAS studies. For each SNP from the recent GWAS, we calculated the power (pj) to observe said effect size in a single-stage study with double the sample size. We then predicted that the total number of SNPs we would observe with that effect size would equal:$$ {p}_j{M}_{T,j} $$
                        , Using the new set of predicted SNPs for each phenotype, we simulated the genotypes for the newly predicted set of SNPs for a sample of 100,000 individuals of European descent, assuming each new SNP was in a unique locus. For example, if for a specific SNP reported in the most recent two-stage GWAS, we expect there to be 10 total SNPs with the same effect size and we have a predicted power of 0.8 to detect the SNP in a double sample size study, we simulated eight SNPs of that effect size and minor allele frequency. In fact, we simulate slightly more by simulating the ceiling of pjMT,j. Reclassification was then assessed using the SNPs in the 2013 GWAS vs. when we had the sum of pjMT,j for all SNPs. We then calculated the AUC in these simulated datasets. Since the AUC from the âcurrentâ here is based just on the SNPs from a subset of all GWAS studies, it will not be directly comparable to the AUC calculated using the NHGRI catalog and the recent large scale GWAS., The number of SNPs meeting the selected P value and LD criteria outlined above increased steadily for all the phenotypes over successive time windows, with the most dramatic increase across all phenotypes occurring from 2011 to 2013 (Fig. 1). As the number of SNPs identified increased, the average effect size per SNP generally decreased (Fig. 2). As more SNPs were discovered, the proportion of individuals classified as Higher Risk also increased (Table 1) and the risk distribution for each phenotype widened (Fig. 3). The proportion of individuals that were reclassified increased substantially as more SNPs were discovered (Table 2). The highest 2-year reclassification rate for each phenotype occurred from 2011 to 2013, and the average reclassification rate from 2011 to 2013 across the phenotypes was 20.4 % and ranged from 16.3 % to 24.4 %. This was also the time period that saw the greatest increase in identified SNPs. Most of this reclassification reflected an improvement in the risk model, as indicated in the positive net reclassification indices in Table 3. Using the three risk categories (Lower, Average, and Higher), the majority of reclassification from 2011 to 2013 was due to movement between the Lower Risk and the Average Risk categories (see Additional file 1: Tables S1a, S2a, S3a, S4a). If the risk categories are grouped into Higher Risk versus Lower or Average Risk, the reclassification proportions from 2011 to 2013 are 7.0 %, 5.2 %, 5.5 %, and 7.4 % for BrCa, CHD, T2D, and PrCa, respectively. The full reclassification tables can be seen in Additional file 1: Tables S1âS4.

                  , We separately analyzed reclassification among those who were in the Higher Risk group in 2011 (Table 4). This was done to assess how much movement there was for individuals most likely to have changes in clinical management due to being classified at high risk. For BrCa, 42 % of the individuals who had been classified as high risk in 2011 moved to a lower risk classification in 2013. Reclassification proportions from 2011 to 2013 for the other three phenotypes ranged from 25 % to 55 %. The vast majority of this reclassification was from Higher Risk to Average Risk, with little movement from Higher Risk to Lower Risk (Additional file 1: Table S5).Table 4

                  , The AUC for the risk prediction models increased modestly from 2007 to 2013, with a mean increase over each 2-year period since 2007 of 0.034 across the four phenotypes. Two examples of larger increases include PrCa from 2007 to 2009 (0.591 - >0.667) and BrCa from 2011 to 2013 (0.634 - >0.671) (Table 5). This may be due to the large amount of SNPs that were discovered in the Michailidou et al. paper released in early 2013 [25]. For PrCa, there were 20 SNPs discovered from 2007 to 2009, bringing the number from five to 25 [27, 40]. The AUC values reported in Table 5 are generally slightly higher than those reported in the literature when validating risk models using similar number of SNPs [20, 41â55]. This is likely due to the compounded effect of overestimates in published individual-SNP ORs [56, 57].Table 5

The net reclassification rates were again positive, indicating model improvement: net reclassification rates were 0.34, 0.082, 0.21, and 0.21 for BrCa, CHD, T2D, and PrCa, respectively (Table 6 and Additional file 1: Table S6). The proportion of individuals moving from Higher Risk to the Lower or Moderate Risk category remained large, ranging from 0.40 to 0.51 (Table 6). Individuals currently classified as Lower Risk or Average Risk were slightly less likely to be reclassified after doubling the sample size. For example, 30 % of individuals currently classified as Lower Risk for CHD were reclassified to Average Risk (none were reclassified as Higher Risk), while only 11 % of those currently classified as Average Risk were reclassified as Lower Risk or Higher Risk.Table 6

                  , One limitation to using reclassification rates as a primary endpoint is that the degree of change in risk for individuals and the cohort as a whole is obscured. For example, one potential explanation for the reclassification rates we observed is that many individuals had small absolute changes in odds which nonetheless resulted in a change in risk categorization based on our defined odds thresholds. Across all phenotypes, roughly half of individuals (51 %) had a change in the adjusted odds of 0.2 or less from 2011 to 2013. However, 17 % of individuals had changes in adjusted odds of greater than 0.5., Individualsâ genetic risk prediction for common complex diseases will change as our knowledge of the genetic underpinnings of these traits changes. At some point, as the known genetic contribution increases and approaches the total (known and unknown proportion) genetic contribution of common SNPs, the change in individualsâ predictions with every new discovery will diminish. We have shown that, depending on phenotype, between 18 % and 50 % of individual risk estimates were reclassified over the time period of 2007 to 2013. Rather than diminishing, the impact of new GWAS-discovered risk alleles remains high and may in fact be increasing, as studies reach a sample size âtipping pointâ and have power to reliably detect many alleles with smaller effects. Eventually we will reach a point of diminishing returns, where larger and larger studies will fail to detect any novel SNPs, but for the time being we are still in the discovery stage., The projected reclassification rate in the near future partly reflects the modest predictive power of current genetic risk prediction algorithms. It also reflects the fact that many common complex phenotypes appear to follow a polygenic inheritance model, with many SNPs of small effect contributing to disease risk. Previous GWAS have had low power to detect most of these SNPs, so published SNPs to date likely reflect only a portion of the heritability attributable to common genetic variation., We observed that the proportions of individuals in the Higher Risk category, defined as greater than 2Ã the mean risk, increased over time. Specifically, we noted a gradual increase in the proportion of individuals at greater than twice the average genetic risk from less than 3 % in 2007 to a total of 5 % to 11 % in 2013 across the four phenotypes. Additionally, increased proportions in the Higher Risk category were noted when risk estimates were projected using double the GWAS sample size. This result was anticipated given that as more risk-associated SNPs are discovered, the total risk distribution widens, and therefore the proportion of individuals at increased risk increases slightly. In other words, discovering new SNPs increases the probability of discovering individuals at the extremes of genetic risk burden., Genetic risk assessment for a given multifactorial condition is most relevant for those who fall in the Higher Risk or Lower Risk categories. In theory, as certainty around risk estimates improve, early or enhanced screening protocols and stricter control of risk factors through lifestyle modification or medical intervention may be warranted for individuals with increased genetic risk profiles. On the other hand, individuals with relatively low genetic risk factors may benefit or avoid disadvantage if they are subject to less screening or fewer preventative measures. For the vast majority with average genetic risk, little change would appear warranted from conventional screening and prevention measures. Currently and in the near future, however, the emphasis is and will be likely placed on patients with increased risk. As individuals in the extremes of the predicted risk distribution are the most important to identify from a clinical decision-making perspective, the possibility of identifying more such individuals over time offers a reason to suggest that risk classification based on common variation may have increased clinical utility in the future., There are pressing questions concerning the validity of risk estimates for those interested in translating the current discoveries from the GWAS era into clinical recommendations, and this study is not intended to address these issues. Our analysis does not address or attempt to account for non-genetic components of risk estimation for any phenotype, such as dietary factors, smoking, or other exposures. Non-genetic risk factors are important components of risk, and for some phenotypes, contribute more to risk of developing disease than does genetic variation. In clinical assessment, therefore, evaluation of non-genetic risk factors will remain important even as risk-prediction models based on common genetic variation improve. Our study, however, focuses only on the genetic risk and how the rapidly evolving data about common genetic variation impacts risk categorization over time. Moreover, we have not addressed the important issue of risk model calibrationâwhether those predicted to be at high risk are indeed at high risk. Model calibration requires large genotyped cohorts with extensive follow-up, and is beyond the scope of our analyses., A key component of the validity of risk projections based on common genetic variation, however, is whether risk predictions are stable as additional SNPs are identified. In other words, what proportion of individuals from the clinically important subgroup currently classified as Higher Risk remains in the Higher Risk category as more SNPs are discovered for a given phenotype? If reclassification is low for those in the Higher Risk category, then considering modifications to screening or preventative measures may be warranted based on current risk estimates. However, if a large proportion of individuals identified as Higher Risk based on early models were later classified as Average Risk or Lower Risk, additional caution would be warranted before basing clinical decisions on a predicted increased risk for a phenotype., Our analysis, based only on the identification of new risk alleles, shows a significant proportion of reclassification for individuals determined to be in the Higher Risk category for each phenotype for the 2-year period as recent as 2011 to 2013. For an individual who underwent a risk evaluation based on known risk-associated SNPs for CHD in 2011, there was a 55 % probability that they would subsequently be reclassified into a lower risk group in 2013 and therefore may have received misguided intervention. Though the downward reclassification rates are lower for other phenotypes, even the smallest rate is 25 % for T2D. Projections based on doubling the GWAS sample size suggest that even much larger samples than are currently available do not resolve the ongoing instability, with projected reclassification rates for individuals at high risk near 50 % for all four phenotypes., We stress that the changes in reclassification rates and net reclassification indices over time that we report here are for illustration purposes only. Both reclassification rates and net reclassification indices are sensitive to the choice of risk thresholds used [58]. The ultimate criteria for benchmarking prediction models against each other depend on the specifics of the clinical setting (including the existence of agreed-upon risk thresholds, specific interventions, and costs and benefits of these interventions) [59, 60]. Precisely because such important evaluations are so context dependent, we have not undertaken them here., In sum, our analysis shows significant instability in predicted risk from common genetic variation for four multifactorial phenotypes. While the results may not be unexpected given the known limitations of the risk prediction using genetic data, they underscore the caution that should be used in interpreting results for an individual patient. Moreover, this analysis demonstrates a consequence of the limited predictive ability of current genetic models, specifically increased reclassification rates in the face of new data. At the same time, reclassification rates should eventually begin to decrease as additional SNPs are identified and increasing proportions of the general population will fall into the clinically relevant Lower Risk and Higher Risk categories, resulting in the opportunity for potentially impactful interventions particularly for individuals in the Higher Risk group. Moreover, the major improvements in number of known SNPs in our analysis underscore the progress that has been and will be made. Hope for potential clinical utility is warranted even in the face of the significant unresolved limitations and challenges.,

                        SpoTyping is a fast and accurate program for in silico spoligotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from next-generation sequencing reads. This novel method achieves high accuracy for reads of both uniform and varying lengths, and is about 20 to 40 times faster than SpolPred. SpoTyping also integrates the function of producing a report summarizing associated epidemiological data from a global database of all isolates having the same spoligotype. SpoTyping is freely available at: https://âgithub.âcom/âxiaeryu/âSpoTyping-v2.â0., Tuberculosis (TB), caused mainly by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a top infectious disease killer around the world and remains an acute international health problem, resulting in an estimated 9.6 million new cases and 1.5 million deaths globally in 2014 [1]. The global emergence and spread of drug-resistant TB have compounded the difficulty of treating and eradicating this disease., Spoligotyping (spacer oligonucleotide typing) is a widely used genotyping method for Mtb, which exploits the genetic diversity in the clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) locus, which is also known as the direct repeat (DR) locus in Mtb genome [2]. Each DR region consists of several copies of the 36 bp DR sequence, which are interspersed with 34 bp to 41 bp non-repetitive spacers [3]. A set of 43 unique spacer sequences is used to classify Mtb strains based on their presence or absence. The patterns of presence and absence in each of the 43 spacer sequences can be summarized with a 43-digit binary code with 1 denoting the presence and 0 denoting the absence for each spacer, which can also be translated into a 15-digit numerical code [4] termed as the spoligotype. Spoligotypes can be used to compare Mtb isolates collected between different laboratories and countries. Spoligotyping is traditionally conducted using the PCR-based reverse line hybridization blotting technique [2]. Various new methods have recently been proposed for spoligotyping, the most of which are microarrays, such as the PixSysn QUAD 4500 Microarrayer [5], DNA microarray [6], hydrogel microarray (biochip) [7], Spoligorifytyping [8], and its follow-up TB-SPRINT [9]. Other spoligotyping methods include those based on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS) platform [10, 11]. Spoligotyping has also been applied to strain typing in other bacteria species such as Legionella pneumophila [12], Campylobacter jejuni [13, 14], and Salmonella [15]., Technological advancements in next-generation sequencing provide single nucleotide resolution for Mtb phylogenetic studies by allowing the construction of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based phylogenetic tree. However, genotyping of bacteria is still needed for fast strain identification and correlation to previous isolates. For previous isolates, particularly the historical isolates, genotypes including spoligotypes may have been determined but whole genome sequences are not available and some isolates are not able to be sequenced. Under such circumstances, in silico genotyping from the whole genome sequences is necessary for correlating current isolates with previously genotyped ones. Several molecular genotyping techniques exist for Mtb, of which the most widely used are: (1) spoligotyping; (2) mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units - variable numbers of tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR); and (3) IS6110-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (IS6110-RFLP) [16]. The inference of MIRU-VNTR from next-generation sequencing reads involves resolving the tandem repeats, which is extremely challenging for the current short sequence reads generated by the most widely used sequencing platforms. IS6110-RFLP commonly has its result based on the DNA fragment blots on electrophoresis gel image and thus focuses on the determination of the fragment lengths, which is also extremely challenging to infer since short read sequencing cannot be used alone to construct finished genomes. Spoligotyping, therefore, provides a unique opportunity to obtain the same result from whole genome sequences as the molecular genotyping result achieved in laboratories, which can correlate the isolates investigated using different approaches. In silico spoligotyping is also important for investigations using public data, where sequencing reads or complete genomic sequences are available but the spoligotypes of the isolates are not reported., 
                        SpolPred [17] is a tool that accurately predicts the spoligotype of Mtb isolates from sequence reads of uniform length obtained from platforms such as Illumina GAII and HiSeq. However, for reads produced by platforms marketed for clinical diagnostics such as Illumina MiSeq and Ion sequencers, where the throughput is moderate and length of the reads are non-uniform, the accuracy of SpolPred is significantly reduced. SpoTyping improves the performance of SpolPred in three ways: (1) SpolPred reads in a fixed number of bases from each sequencing read as specified by the user. As a result, for sequencing experiments with non-uniform read length, the accuracy of prediction is highly dependent on the choices of the read length by the users. SpoTyping, by reading in the full length of the reads, makes use of all the available sequence data. (2) SpolPred requires the user to specify a direction for the reads, which can be either direct or reverse. However, since each FASTQ file consists of both direct and reverse reads, SpolPred only utilizes a fraction of the input sequence reads which can lead to incorrect predictions for sequencing experiments with low throughput. SpoTyping explicitly considers the reads in both directions, thereby using all the information presented in the sequence reads. (3) SpolPred relies on an inefficient sequence search algorithm, whereas SpoTyping integrates the BLAST algorithm in the search which reduces the time of the search considerably. In addition to the improvements listed above, SpoTyping also comes with novel functions not previously found in SpolPred or other software: (1) For TB disease outbreak investigation, it is necessary to quickly identify isolates with matching spoligotypes. SpoTyping thus automatically queries SITVIT [18], a global Mtb molecular markers database to retrieve associated epidemiological data for isolates with matched spoligotypes in an Excel spreadsheet, which can be presented as a graphical report showing the distribution summaries of the meta-data corresponding to the clades, years, and countries of isolation for these isolates. (2) SpoTyping works on different input files such as next-generations sequencing reads in FASTQ format, and complete genomic sequences or assembled contigs in FASTA format. (3) SpoTyping can be run on most operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and Mac OS, either as a non-interactive script which can be integrated into individual analysis pipelines or as an interactive application with a graphical user interface. Thus, we believe SpoTyping would be a useful tool for public health surveillance and genotyping from next-generation sequencing data in microbiological clinical diagnostic of Mtb strains., 
                        SpoTyping is implemented with Python and accepts two kinds of input files: single-end or pair-end sequence reads in FASTQ format, and complete genomic sequences or assembled contigs in FASTA format. A schematic representation of the SpoTyping workflow is shown in Fig. 1. When the input files are sequence reads, SpoTyping first concatenates all sequence reads in the input FASTQ file(s) into a single contiguous sequence in FASTA format which would be constructed into a BLAST [19] nucleotide database. The current program default (enabling the swift mode) is to read in no more than 250 Mbp of the sequence reads, which corresponds to a read depth of approximately 55X of the Mtb genome and would be sufficient in most situations. Disabling the swift mode would require SpoTyping to utilize all sequence reads with increased execution time. The set of 43 spacer sequences, each of 25 bp in length, would be queried against the constructed database using the standard nucleotide BLAST program. The BLAST output is then parsed to determine the number of hits for each spacer sequence in the input file(s). A maximum of one mismatch out of 25 bp of the spacer sequence is allowed for a BLAST match to be considered as a hit. For sequence reads, if a spacer sequence is absent in the Mtb isolate, then no or very few hits would be identified, while if the number of hits exceeds a threshold (hit threshold has a default of five error-free hits and six 1-error-tolerant hits), it indicates the presence of the spacer sequence where the number of hits correlates with the sequence read depth of the locus. For genomic sequences or assembled contigs, the presence of one hit for a spacer sequence indicates the presence of the spacer. The binary string of 43 digits, each digit representing one of the 43 spacer sequences with 0 indicating absence and 1 indicating presence, can therefore be written into an octal code that defines the spoligotype of the Mtb isolate. The predicted spoligotype is then automatically queried in the SITVIT database to retrieve all reported isolates having identical spoligotypes, where associated data corresponding to the MIRU12, VNTR, SIT, MIT, VIT, clades, countries of origin, countries of isolation, and year of report for these isolates would be downloaded in an Excel spreadsheet. SpoTyping also includes an R script that can present summary statistics of the associated meta-data as a pdf report.
                    Fig. 1
                      A schematic representation of the SpoTyping workflow. If the specified input contains sequencing reads, SpoTyping first concatenates the sequencing reads to form an artificial sequence. The artificial sequence, or genetic sequences when the input contains complete genomic sequence or assembled contigs, would be built into the BLAST database. After querying the 43 spacer sequences in the database, the results are parsed to count the number of hits for each spacer sequence. A hit threshold is set to define a spacer as âpresentâ in the genome, resulting in a 43-digit binary code with 1 as present and 0 as absent, which is further translated into the octal code of the spoligotype. The SITVIT database is then queried to identify matching isolates having the same spoligotype, where the associated data of the matched isolates are downloaded and summarized as pie charts
                    , The accuracy of SpoTyping was assessed in comparison with SpolPred on three datasets: (1) 161 isolates sequenced on Illumina HiSeq (SRA: SRA065095); (2) 30 isolates sequenced on Illumina MiSeq (ENA: PRJNA218508); and (3) 16 isolates sequenced on Ion Torrent (ENA: PRJEB6576). The first assessment was conducted on a dataset of 161 Mtb isolates sequenced on Illumina HiSeq with experimentally determined spoligotypes reported [20]. Both SpoTyping and SpolPred were run with default parameters. The predicted octal codes were each queried in the SITVIT database to identify the matching spoligotype for comparison with the reported spoligotype. Discordant results were examined by searching the spacer sequences on the contigs assembled using the de novo assembly software Velvet [21]. The next assessment was conducted on a dataset of 30 Mtb isolates sequenced on Illumina MiSeq without reported spoligotypes. The reference spoligotype for each isolate was determined by manual inspection of the BLAST output file to determine the number of hits for each spacer sequence in the sequence reads. Given that the sequence read depths are above 20X for all isolates, no hit for a spacer sequence is a strong indication of its absence while a number of above five hits is a strong indication of the presence of the spacer sequence. While a judgement cannot be safely made based on a hit number of 1 to 5, isolates with at least one such case were removed from the study, leaving only isolates with confident reference spoligotypes. SpoTyping was run with default parameters while SpolPred calls for a specified read length, where a range of read lengths were used based on the read length percentiles from 0.04 to 1 at a step of 0.04, resulting in a total of 25 predictions for each isolate. The accuracy of SpoTyping was also assessed in comparison with SpolPred on a dataset of 16 Mtb isolates sequenced on Ion Torrent. The reference spoligotypes were determined similarly as those for Illumina MiSeq data. The running parameters were also similar as those for Illumina MiSeq data., The time performance of SpoTyping was compared with SpolPred based on the first dataset. The programs were run on a 64-bit Fedora Linux server workstation having a 2.0 GHz quad processor and 32 GB RAM. Both SpoTyping and SpolPred were run twice for each isolate either with or without the swift mode. Default parameters were used for SpoTyping swift mode, while for non-swift mode, 10 error-free hits or 12 1-error-tolerant hits (options of -m 10 -r 12) was taken as the hit threshold due to the high sequencing coverage to eliminate false positives. For SpolPred, the pair-end sequence reads were first concatenated (concatenation time not counted toward the running time). The read lengths were set to be the actual read lengths. The hit threshold was similarly set to be 10 (option of -m 10) in the non-swift mode., The performance of SpoTyping was assessed for various sequence read depths to determine its applicable range, where we determined the accuracies of the SpoTyping prediction for: (1) an H37Ra Mtb isolate which had a sequencing throughput of 3,000 Mbp (approximately 670X); and (2) a Beijing-genotype Mtb isolate with a sequencing throughput of 2,700 Mbp (approximately 600X) by performing 50 iterations each for six down-sampling ratios of 50 %, 20 %, 10 %, 5 %, 2 %, and 1 % of the initial number of reads for each isolate. In each down-sampling experiment, a certain percent of the sequence reads were randomly selected from the original FASTQ file to form a new file with a lower read depth, where the percentage is called the down-sampling ratio. For all of the down-sampling experiments, default settings were used except for the categories of 2 % and 1 % where the hit threshold was set to two error-free hits and three 1-error-tolerant hits (options of -m 2 -r 3). The false positives caused by the concatenation of sequence reads were also assessed in the down-sampling experiment., The selection of the hit thresholds was also based on the down-sampling experiments. In each down-sampling experiment, the number of both error-free hits and 1-error-tolerant hits for each spacer identified by SpoTyping were divided by the estimated read depth (number of sequence bases/ 4,500,000) of the experiment, representing the number of hits as a percentage of the estimated read depth. For each spacer in each experiment, the percentage is used as the feature to classify a spacer as present or absent, while the spacerâs actual class of presence or absence is used to assess whether the classification is correct. A set of percentages was used as the thresholds to calculate the respective true positive rates and false positive rates, which were plotted as a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The thresholds were selected to maximize the true positive rate while minimizing the false positive rate., The Beijing-genotype isolate can be accessed through the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) code ERP006354. The H37Ra isolate is a laboratory strain that was sequenced as part of a validation sequencing run, and the FASTQ files will be provided upon request., For all the 161 Mtb isolates, SpoTyping and SpolPred predicted the same spoligotypes (Additional file 1: Table S1), of which 20 isolates either without a match in the SITVIT database or reported as âNewâ were excluded from subsequent comparisons. Of the remaining 141 isolates, predictions of SpoTyping and the laboratory determined spoligotypes for 127 isolates (90.07 %) were identical. For the 14 discordant isolates, the spacer sequences were searched in the assembled contigs to determine the spoligotypes, which are all concordant with the predictions from SpoTyping (Additional file 1: Table S2)., The accuracy of SpoTyping was then assessed in comparison with SpolPred on 30 Mtb isolates sequenced on Illumina MiSeq, among which 21 passed filtering for having reference spoligotypes confidently determined. SpoTyping correctly inferred the spoligotypes for all 21 isolates. Since SpolPred requires for a read length to be specified as input, a range of read lengths were assessed based on the percentiles from 0.04 to 1 at a step of 0.04, resulting in a total of 25 predictions for each isolate whose read length specifications are summarized in Additional file 1: Table S3. At each percentile, the predictions for the 21 isolates were analyzed to calculate the prediction accuracy, which is summarized in Fig. 2 and Additional file 1: Table S4. SpolPred performs the best using the read lengths at the 0.36, 0.40, or 0.44 percentiles, with accuracies around 50 %. The prediction accuracy of SpolPred is significantly lower than that obtained by SpoTyping and is also highly dependent on the choice of read length used as input which in itself is difficult to determine.
                      Fig. 2
                        Prediction accuracy of Mtb isolates sequenced on Illumina MiSeq and Ion Torrent. SpolPred requires a read length to be specified which results in inconsistent predictions for different specifications. The accuracy assessment was conducted between SpoTyping (a) and SpolPred (b) on 21 MiSeq-sequenced isolates and 11 Ion-sequenced isolates, with SpoTyping predictions using default parameters and SpolPred predictions using different read length percentiles as the input read lengths. While SpoTyping have perfect accuracies for both datasets, SpolPred gives varying accuracies depending on the read length, which are always lower than 50 %
                      , The accuracy for spoligotype inference was also determined on 16 Mtb isolates sequenced on Ion Torrent with spoligotypes reported to be all Beijing genotype [22]. Of the 16 isolates, 11 have confidently determined spoligotypes, which are all of the spoligotype â000000000003771â as are consistent with the reported Beijing genotype. SpoTyping makes correct prediction for all the 11 isolates. The performance of SpolPred is summarized in Fig. 2, Additional file 1: Table S5 and Table S6. SpolPred performs best using the read length at the 0.08 and 0.12 percentile, with accuracies of only around 10 %., For the 161 Mtb isolates tested, SpoTyping is about 20 to 40 times faster than SpolPred, with SpoTyping taking an average of 28.8 s (standard deviation is 5.3 s) in its swift mode, and an average of 56.4 s (standard deviation is 8.0 s) to process all reads, while SpolPred took an average of 17 min 19.3 s (standard deviation is 1 min 35.3 s) by using the -s option, or an average of 18 min 20.0 s (standard deviation is 50.2 s) to process all reads (Additional file 1: Table S1)., Based on the down-sampling experiments which first explore the applicable throughput for accurate spoligotype inference, SpoTyping is able to efficiently and accurately predict the spoligotype for isolates having sequencing throughput over 54 Mbp (read depth of approximately 12X) with accuracies above 98 % (Fig. 3, Additional file 1: Table S7 for H37Ra and Additional file 1: Table S8 for Beijing). However, for isolates that are sequenced at very low coverage (below 10X), using the lower threshold is still not sufficient to make accurate predictions as some of the spacer sequences would not be adequately sequenced and represented in the input FASTQ file(s).
                      Fig. 3
                        Assessing the accuracy of SpoTyping across various sequence read depths for H37Ra and Beijing-genotype isolates. With blue points denoting the Beijing genotype, pink points denoting H37Ra, the prediction accuracies were assessed with the sequencing throughput measured by the number of bases for all the down-sampling experiments. SpoTyping is suitable for sequencing runs with throughput over 54 Mbp (estimated depth of approximately 12X), where the accuracy is almost 100 %
                      , Since SpoTyping concatenates sequence reads into an artificial sequence to create the BLAST database, an immediate concern is the false positives created due to chimera sequences. In all of 600 down-sampling experiments performed for both H37Ra and Beijing genotype Mtb isolates, the maximum number of false positive hit is 1 for both error-free hits and 1-error-tolerant hits. Of the experiments, 98.3 % (590/600) show no false positive error-free hits while 95.7 % (574/600) show no false positive 1-error-tolerant hits. The likelihood of false positives created due to chimera sequences is thus low which can be further reduced by setting more stringent hit thresholds., We evaluated the choice of the hit thresholds to determine the presence or absence of a spacer sequence used in SpoTyping. The evaluation was conducted in the down-sampling experiments, based on the groups with down-sampling ratios from 2 % to 50 % (read depths between approximately 12X and approximately 300X) where accurate inferences for the spacer sequences are possible to be made. A total of 21,586 spacer sequence instances ((5 down-sampling ratios * 50 rounds for each down-sampling ratio * 43 spacer for each roundâ+â43 spacers without down-sampling)â=â10,793 spacers for each of the two strains) with their respective number of hits identified by SpoTyping were included in the analysis, of which 10,040 are absent cases and 11,546 are present cases. The number of hits was divided by the estimated read depth to represent the number of hits as a percentage of the read depth in order to adjust for the difference in sequencing throughput. A set of percentages was used as the thresholds to calculate the respective true positive rates and false positive rates, which were plotted as an ROC curve (Fig. 4). The ROC curves for both the error-free hits (Fig. 4a) and 1-error-tolerant hits (Fig. 4b) show very high true positive rates and very low false positive rates, with the areas under the ROC being 0.9999997 and 0.9999998, respectively. False positive rates are always nearly 0, while the true positive rates are above 99 % by setting the thresholds to be 1.80 % to 14.86 % of the read depth for error-free hits and 1.80 % to 14.88 % of the read depth for 1-error-tolerant hits. Thus the default thresholds of five error-free hits and six 1-error-tolerant hits are applicable to sequencing experiments with estimated read depths between approximately 30X and approximately 280X. The thresholds can be adjusted accordingly given sequencing throughputs beyond this range.
                      Fig. 4
                        ROC curves for the selection of hit thresholds. The ROC curves were plotted for both error-free hits (a) and 1-error-tolerant hits (b) to select the hit thresholds. Diagonal lines, also known as lines of no discrimination, were plotted as references of random guess. The threshold evaluation was based on a percentage calculated as the number of hits divided by the estimated read depth. A set of percentages was used as the thresholds to calculate the respective true positive rates and false positive rates, which were plotted as the ROC curves. Both ROC curves show constantly high true positive rates and low false positive rates, with the areas under the ROC being 0.9999997 and 0.9999998, respectively
                      , The increasing global burden of TB, especially drug-resistant strains, has put a significant spotlight on pathogen whole genome sequencing as a rapid diagnostic tool, which is of great relevance to both public health surveillance and clinical treatment. The application of next-generation sequencing in clinical microbiology requires fast and easy-to-use software that is able to accurately produce easily comprehensible results. As shown, SpoTyping is able to accurately determine the spoligotype of the Mtb isolate rapidly. Contrary to SpolPred which is sensitive to the user-specified read length and gives inconsistent predictions at different read lengths, SpoTyping gives accurate predictions based on sequence reads produced from different technologies regardless of the length uniformity of the sequence reads and is 20 to 40 times faster than SpolPred. The additional functions of database query, information visualization and report generation provided by SpoTyping where the predicted spoligotype is automatically queried in the SITVIT database to retrieve all associated epidemiological data corresponding to the MIRU12, VNTR, SIT, MIT, VIT, clades, countries of origin, countries of isolation, and year of report and presented as a report would be a useful tool for public health surveillance of Mtb strains causing tuberculosis., While there are several molecular typing techniques for Mtb, the most widely used are spoligotyping, MIRU-VNTR, and IS6110-RFLP. Spoligotyping, though being a relatively simple, cost-effective, and high-throughput method, suffers from the limitations of: (1) having relatively low discriminatory power [23] due to its use of only a single genetic locus; and (2) having limited use in phylogenetic study. Among the genotyping methods for Mtb, a combination of spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR was reported to be the best strategy [24, 25]. However, significant technical challenges currently exist for the accurate in silico typing from next-generation sequencing reads of MIRU-VNTR which involves resolving tandem repeats and IS6110-RFLP whose result is based on DNA fragment blots on electrophoresis gel image and thus involves the determination of the fragment lengths. Spoligotyping, as a result, provides a unique chance to obtain the same result from whole genome sequences as the molecular typing result achieved in laboratories, which can correlate the isolates investigated with different approaches. Though spoligotyping has less discrimination power than SNP phylogeny inferred from whole genome sequences, it is unique in correlating the genomic data produced in research labs and the molecular typing data from clinical laboratories. Thus in silico spoligotyping is not only a genotyping method for Mtb isolate differentiation, but also a bridge between isolates with whole genome sequences available and isolates typed and investigated with traditional laboratory protocols, especially those historical isolates that are not sequenced. Inexorably, clinical surveillance and management of TB, particularly for disease diagnosis and treatment, will progress towards the use of direct Mtb sequencing. Thus the ease of use and interpretability of the results will be of considerable importance to users within a clinical setting, which is well achieved with SpoTyping., A recently published letter reported CASTB, an analysis server for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, which provides next-generation sequencing data analysis tools for virtual typing (spoligotyping included), virtual drug resistance analysis, and phylogenetic analysis [26]. While the webserver provides a comprehensive overview at the sequencing data, the performance of each tool is not well evaluated in the publication. More accurate and well assessed tools are thus needed for further analysis. SpoTyping is well assessed to provide high accuracy for in silico spoligotyping and thus demonstrates the reliability of the results. SpoTyping also benefits from its open source nature that it can be easily integrated into in-house analysis pipelines for in-depth analysis of the sequencing data. When talking about execution time, services provided by web servers may be very slow due to the inherent issues such as the process of data uploading and the availability of the computational resources. SpoTyping, on the other hand, can be set up locally and provides the spoligotyping result within a minute., For the 14 discordant spoligotypes between the laboratory tests and the in silico predictions made by SpoTyping in the 161 Mtb isolates sequenced on Illumina HiSeq, the SNP-based phylogenetic tree of these 161 Mtb isolates in the original article [20] was examined to compare the lineage with the spoligotyping results (Additional file 1: Table S9). Out of the 14 discordant results, three showed better concordance of the in silico prediction with the lineage on the tree. As an example, an isolate (Accession: SRR671868, Strain: 143) located at Lineage 4.2 on the SNP-based phylogenetic tree is reported to be a Beijing genotype based on the laboratory test in the publication, while predicted to be a T2 genotype by SpoTyping. However, the Beijing genotype is usually found at East Asia Lineage 2, while Lineage 4 usually harbors the Euro-American genotypes. One of the discrepancies may be caused by the different naming of spoligotypes in different databases (Beijing and Beijing-like). Definite conclusion cannot be made for the remaining 10 isolates for which the reported spoligotype and in silico predicted spoligotype are different while the lineages for both spoligotypes are similar (T2 and H3, for example). For such isolates, the difference could be due to the discrepancy between laboratory tests and the genomic features., 
                        SpoTyping is an accurate, fast, and easy-to-use program for in silico spoligotyping of Mtb isolates from next-generation sequencing reads, complete genomic sequences, and assembled contigs. In addition, SpoTyping automatically queries the global Mtb molecular markers database SITVIT to retrieve associated data for matching isolates with the inferred spoligotypes, which can be summarized graphically to generate a report. SpoTyping would be a useful tool for public health surveillance and genotyping of Mtb strains.,

                Background
                Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are linked both with host genetics and with environmental factors, including dysbioses of the gut microbiota. However, it is unclear whether these microbial changes precede disease onset. Twin cohorts present a unique genetically-controlled opportunity to study the relationships between lifestyle factors and the microbiome. In particular, we hypothesized that family-independent changes in microbial composition and metabolic function during the sub-clinical state of T2D could be either causal or early biomarkers of progression.
              
                Methods
                We collected fecal samples and clinical metadata from 20 monozygotic Korean twins at up to two time points, resulting in 36 stool shotgun metagenomes. While the participants were neither obese nor diabetic, they spanned the entire range of healthy to near-clinical values and thus enabled the study of microbial associations during sub-clinical disease while accounting for genetic background.
              
                Results
                We found changes both in composition and in function of the sub-clinical gut microbiome, including a decrease in Akkermansia muciniphila suggesting a role prior to the onset of disease, and functional changes reflecting a response to oxidative stress comparable to that previously observed in chronic T2D and inflammatory bowel diseases. Finally, our unique study design allowed us to examine the strain similarity between twins, and we found that twins demonstrate strain-level differences in composition despite species-level similarities.
              
                Conclusions
                These changes in the microbiome might be used for the early diagnosis of an inflamed gut and T2D prior to clinical onset of the disease and will help to advance toward microbial interventions.

However, it is unclear whether these microbial changes precede disease onset. Twin cohorts present a unique genetically-controlled opportunity to study the relationships between lifestyle factors and the microbiome. In particular, we hypothesized that family-independent changes in microbial composition and metabolic function during the sub-clinical state of T2D could be either causal or early biomarkers of progression., We collected fecal samples and clinical metadata from 20 monozygotic Korean twins at up to two time points, resulting in 36 stool shotgun metagenomes. While the participants were neither obese nor diabetic, they spanned the entire range of healthy to near-clinical values and thus enabled the study of microbial associations during sub-clinical disease while accounting for genetic background., We found changes both in composition and in function of the sub-clinical gut microbiome, including a decrease in Akkermansia muciniphila suggesting a role prior to the onset of disease, and functional changes reflecting a response to oxidative stress comparable to that previously observed in chronic T2D and inflammatory bowel diseases. Finally, our unique study design allowed us to examine the strain similarity between twins, and we found that twins demonstrate strain-level differences in composition despite species-level similarities., These changes in the microbiome might be used for the early diagnosis of an inflamed gut and T2D prior to clinical onset of the disease and will help to advance toward microbial interventions., The human gut microbiota plays an important role in health and disease [1, 2] and can be viewed as a mirror into the host physiology. One of the primary roles of the microbiota is energy harvest; thus, it is not surprising that microbial dysbiosis has been associated with various metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes (T2D) [3, 4] and obesity [5â7]. T2D is often a consequence of obesity. As the diagnosis is threshold-based, risk of developing T2D in the near future correlates with high levels of two biomarkers, fasting blood sugar (FBS) and HbA1c, even when they do not meet the clinical criteria (HbA1c >6.5 % or FBS >125). However, the microbial changes that occur in the sub-clinical state, prior to the onset of disease, have never been examined, but may potentially be used for early diagnosis and intervention., Previous profiles of the gut microbiome during clinical T2D have found compositional changes between patients and healthy controls [3, 4], including an obesity-related change in the abundance ratio of Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes [5, 8], and a decreased abundance of mucin-degrading Akkermansia muciniphila in overweight children [9] and pregnant women [10, 11]. However, there is no strong consensus across studies in taxa changing in obese versus lean individuals [12]. The causes for this inconsistency may be either technical or biological. From a technical standpoint, a lack of consistent standard operating procedures for sample preparation and sequencing can lead to great variance between different labs and studies [12]. Biologically, the specific composition of the community may be much less important than its overall functional capability., Indeed, there is greater consensus between these studies when microbial functional dysbioses are considered rather than microbial composition [4]. The gut communities of T2D patients showed increased capacity for oxidative stress resistance, and a decreased capacity for flagellar assembly and riboflavin metabolism [3, 4]. Interestingly, oxidative stress resistance was also enriched in the guts of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) [13], potentially indicating that the microbiome is generally stressed by low-level inflammation and immune activation, which may be present at the sub-clinical state of T2D as well., Despite recent studies associating the microbiome with T2D [3, 4] and obesity [6, 8], all previous work has examined individuals with well-established disease. These data may be further influenced by additional factors, such as decreased subject mobility, and it is difficult to conclude from study design whether the observed microbial changes preceded the onset of disease. Furthermore, these studies have rarely taken into account the various genetic backgrounds of the patients. We have addressed these issues by performing the first metagenomic profile of the gut microbiome of monozygotic (MZ) twins, spanning the entire healthy range of T2D clinical indicators, including body mass index (BMI) and fasting blood sugar (FBS). Identifying gradient-like associations between these parameters and gut microbiome features in the sub-clinical state of these diseases will open the way to discover potential markers for early diagnosis of T2D and obesity., We found several taxa associated with sub-clinical changes in BMI, blood pressure, sugar, and triglycerides, including enrichment of the Roseburia genus and depletion of the Akkermansia muciniphila species. Additionally, riboflavin and NAD biosynthesis were metagenomically enriched in participants with high blood pressure and BMI values. Interestingly, similar functional enrichments are shared with other gut inflammatory conditions such as IBD [13] and clinically-established T2D [3], suggesting shifts in the gut microbial population prior to full disease onset that may be either causal or an early correlative indicator., Finally, this cohort included a unique combination of MZ twins and longitudinal sampling, which allowed us to identify the degree to which specific microbial strains were shared between the guts of siblings and maintained over time. Despite the small size of this targeted cohort, the deep metagenomic sequencing (mean 3.5 Gnt per sample) combined with a focus on taxa of high relative abundance (see Methods) enabled us to determine strain similarity with high resolution in these data. MZ twins have also been previously observed to share a greater proportion of gut microbes than unrelated individuals [6], and some strains appear to be maintained within the guts of isolated individuals for months to years [14]. Surprisingly, we observed that while twins in our MZ cohort indeed share a substantial subset of microbial species, strains within these species differ between related twins. Thus, the gut microbial similarities of twins may arise from sources such as genetic pressure to acquire certain species (but not specific strains), or from early colonization by the same strains, with subsequent genetic divergence over the course of a lifetime., Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Samsung Medical Center, Busan Paik Hospital, and Seoul National University (IRB No. 144-2011-07-11)., The participants were MZ twins who enrolled for the Healthy Twin study in Seoul and Busan, South Korea. The zygosity of twins was determined using AmpFlSTR Identifier Kit with 16 short tandem repeat markers (15 autosomal STR markersâ+âone sex determining marker) or a questionnaire with a validated accuracy of >90 % [15]. Details on methodology of this cohort have been previously described [16]., A total of 36 fecal samples from the participants were collected: samples from two twin pairs were taken once and those from eight twin pairs were obtained twice with an average interval of 2 years. Twins were in the age range of 30-48 years at the first sampling point. Fecal samples were taken in conjunction with a health examination and immediately stored at -25 Â°C. They were subsequently transported to the two central clinics and stored at -80 Â°C until DNA extraction. Blood samples were drawn by vein puncture after an overnight fast and sent to a central laboratory to measure biochemical factors., During each visit, individuals also completed a questionnaire recording life style, medication, and dietary habits. Anthropometrical measurements (height, weight, waist circumference, and so on) and biochemical tests (glucose, hsCRP, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, triglyceride, and so on) were also conducted (Additional file 1: Table S1). The derived homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index uses the fasting blood sugar and insulin to predict the insulin resistance of patients [17] and was calculated as standard (insulin * glucose)/405, both measured after fasting and glucose levels measured in mg/dL [17]., Total DNA was extracted from each fecal sample using the MoBio Power Soil DNA Isolation kit (MoBio, Solana Beach, CA, USA) according to the manufacturerâs instructions and stored at -80 Â°C until subsequent analysis. All samples were sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq2000 instrument, which produced paired-end reads of 101 nt, yielding average 3.5 Gnt per each of fecal samples., The gut microbial composition of each sample was profiled using MetaPhlAn [18]. MetaPhlAn uses a unique set of markers for each species (and higher level clades) to estimate the abundance of species in each sample according to the number of mapped reads to its markers. The relative abundances of the gut microbial functional pathways from metagenomically sequenced communities were determined using HUMAnN [19]. HUMAnN maps the sequenced reads to a non-redundant set of genes extracted from the KEGG database [20] and estimates the abundance level of each functional module by the number of matches to member genes fully compatible with it being carried out by one or more microbes., To identify significant associations between microbial and phenotypic variables, we applied a linear multivariate regression model specifically adapted to microbiome data (MaAsLin, Multivariate microbial Association by Linear models [13]). MaAsLin constructs boosted, additive general linear models to associate metadata and transformed microbial taxonomic or functional relative abundances. Since microbial community profiles are typically high-dimensional, boosting is used for feature selection over potential covariates to identify those most associated with each microbial feature. Selected metadata are then used in a general linear model with metadata as predictors and arcsin-square root transformed microbial relative abundances as the responses. In this study, model covariates of interest comprised of clinical variables included in Additional file 1: Table S1, and each model also included age, smoking status, sex, and twin as potential confounders (the latter as a random effect to accommodate repeated longitudinal measures)., We performed taxonomic profiling with MetaPhlAn [18]. Briefly, MetaPhlAn operates by mapping raw sequence reads to a database of pre-defined clade-specific marker genes. Markers are those genes occurring in isolates from a particular clade but not outside of that clade. After mapping reads to clade-specific marker genes, the resulting raw counts are normalized for total marker gene length and outliers, yielding profiles of: (1) clade relative abundance; (2) marker gene presence/absence; and (3) marker gene abundance (in reads-per-kb (RPK) units, where 10 RPK would correspond to aboutâÃ1 coverage, given our 100 bp reads). Due to gene gain and loss events, an individual strain will not necessarily carry all of the markers associated with its corresponding species. A specific pattern of marker presence and absence can therefore be used as a molecular âbarcodeâ to identify a strain across samples. We next compared the marker gene abundance profiles of various samples (unrelated, twin or self; with median marker abundance >5 RPK) using a Bray-Curtis distance., Spearman correlation was calculated between the profiles of each microbe and each function to generate the taxon-function correlation matrix. The KEGG database [20] was used to identify the âencodedâ correlations, by calculating the fraction of its reference sequences that include sufficient genes for any given module. The microbial co-occurrence matrix was calculated using spearman correlation between all taxa profiles to identify the âassociatedâ correlations., The prevalence and average abundances of all clades were calculated within our cohort and the HMP [21], and these were compared using Pearson correlation. Prevalence was defined as percent of samples with >0.001 relative abundance for each species, and average abundance was calculated only for samples passing that criterion., Sequences generated in this study are publicly available at the European nucleotide archive (ERP002391)., We collected fecal samples from 20 MZ Korean twins (10 twin pairs) at up to two time points each (12-44 months apart), resulting in 36 samples sequenced using metagenomic shotgun sequencing. In addition, multiple clinical parameters were measured at each sampling point, including body mass index (BMI), fasting blood sugar (FBS), cholesterol levels (LDL, HDL), fasting blood insulin (FBI), and renal and liver function (Additional file 1: Table S1), spanning the typical healthy range of these variables (Additional file 2: Figure S1). Species-level microbial abundance profiles were inferred using MetaPhlAn [18], and functional gene and pathway abundance profiles were generated using HUMAnN [19]. These microbial and functional profiles were tested for statistically significant association with clinical parameters using the MaAsLin [13] sparse multivariate linear model (Fig. 1a).

                        Study design for sub-clinical gut microbiome analysis in obesity and type 2 diabetes. a Stool and blood samples were collected at one to two time points from 10 MZ twin pairs. DNA was extracted from the stool samples and used for shotgun metagenomic sequencing, from which community composition and function were profiled using MetaPhlAn [18] and HUMAnN [19], respectively. Clinical biomarkers including sugar metabolism measurements (fasting blood sugar (FBS) and insulin (FBI)), inflammation markers (hsCRP) and others (Additional file 1: Table S1) were derived from accompanying blood samples. Finally, we determined significant associations between these clinical biomarkers and microbial taxa and functions using MaAsLin [13]. b Overall covariation of taxonomic profiles and the clinical biomarkers and taxa enriched among distinct sample subsets.

Comparisons are colored by the maximal age of the participants involved; P values were calculated using a t-test
                      , As is typical in the gut, the taxa that vary most widely in our cohort were members of the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and at lower abundances the Esherichia, Methanobrevibacter, and Bifidobacterium genera (Fig. 1b). The x-axis depicts mostly the Firmicutes (left) to Bacteroidetes (ratio), as observed before [22], with a modest positive association between Bacteroides and BMI (see below). The y-axis is dominated by less prevalent or more variable genera, like Methanobrevibacter (25 % prevalence) and Bifidobacterium (2.7-3.3 coefficient of variation; Additional file 3: Table S2). The Esherichia and Prevotella genera are prevalent in our cohort (92 and 81 %, respectively, see Additional file 3: Table S2), but only a few individuals have high abundances of one or both genera, driving their contribution to population variability. Overall, we found that the prevalence and abundance profiles of the various taxa in our data are consistent with those measured in Western populations [21]; P valueâ=â0.0001 by Pearson correlation; Additional file 4: Figure S2)., In our cohort, clinical parameters such as BMI (Fig. 1c) and microbial community composition (Fig. 1d) were both more similar between twins than between unrelated individuals, and both were self-similar over time. BMI is most stable between âselfâ samples, especially since no individual has become obese during this study, and indeed, twins are more concordant on BMI compared to unrelated [6]. When comparing their microbial composition we found that, as expected, twins were somewhat more similar than unrelated [6], but self-samples were significantly more stable [21], indicating that for both clinical and microbial phenotypes, longitudinal samples were more similar than twins, which were in turn more similar than unrelated., Several organisms were prevalent (present in >50 % of individuals) in this cohort, although often at relatively low abundance levels. Some of these are shared with other globally surveyed populations, while others were unusually prevalent in this population (Fig. 2a). Shared organisms included Eubacterium rectale, Roseburia intestinalis, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which are similarly prevalent in our cohort and in Western population (94-96 %, 83-89 %, and 96-97 %, respectively) and with similar relative abundances (5 %, approximately 1 %, and 2-4 %, respectively), confirming the similarity between this cohort and Western population.

                      , Less prevalent organisms included Methanobrevibacter smithii, the predominant archaeon in the human gut [23] with the important role of reducing the hydrogen via methanogenesis. M. smithii here mirrored its relatively low prevalence as seen in Western populations (25 %, compared to 21 % in the Human Microbiome Project (HMP)) [21], but with higher average relative abundance when present (9 %, compared to 0.3 %) [21]. Despite the major differences in the Korean diet and environment, M. smithii is still the major microbe likely responsible for this function., Several organisms, including Bifidobacterium longum, Escherichia coli, Prevotella copri, and Bacteroides plebeius, were significantly more prevalent in our population compared to that of the HMP (Additional file 3: Table S2). It has been previously shown that Prevotella is more common in international cohorts [24], and indeed we found P. copri present in 81 % of our samples, compared to 16 % in the HMP [21]. Moreover, we found lower abundance of P. copri in our cohort when present (approximately 10 % relative abundance), unlike the high 37 % relative abundance found in the individuals who carry it in the HMPâs Western population [21], although the overall average of P. copri relative abundance in all individuals is similar between cohorts (6-8 %)., Another difference between the Korean and Western populations was Bifidobacterium longum, a microbe that ferments sugars into lactic acid noted as one of the first colonizers of the infant gut [25]. It was carried at an unusually high prevalence of 94 % (with average relative abundance of 2.5 %), in contrast to its presence in the HMP of 59 % prevalence and 0.4 % relative abundance [21]. Bacteroides plebeius was likewise enriched here, with 97 % prevalence in our cohort and only 9 % in the HMP [21]. P. plebius has been previously found in Japanese populations, likely due to its capability to break down complex carbohydrates specific to seaweed [26], and it may play a similar role in the guts of Koreans, as this is a major staple of their diet., As has been previously observed [21], despite variability in the composition of the microbiome among these individuals, the distribution of microbial metabolic processes remained relatively stable (Fig. 2b, Additional file 5: Figure S3). One of the most variable modules was the transport system of autoinducer-2 (AI-2), a quorum-sensing signaling molecule traditionally associated with the Enterobacteriaceae and Vibrionaceae [27] and recently characterized in some Bifidobacterium species [28]. We also see striking variability in the biosynthesis of GABA, a major neurotransmitter in the central nervous system that has also been recently shown to be produced by some Bifidobacterium species [29]. Both these modules had a striking 3.8 coefficient of variance and approximately 18 % prevalence (compared to 94 % and 60 % in Western population, respectively) and shared similar abundance profiles in our data, suggesting a potential link between the two processes, perhaps through carriage by specific Bifidobacterium strains. As a control, we also see several ubiquitous âhousekeepingâ processes such as the ribosome and translation, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis were present at high levels with low variability among individuals (>4 % average relative abundance and 100 % prevalence, Additional file 3: Table S2 and Additional file 5: Figure S3)., We investigated the relationship between host clinical phenotype and the gut microbiome by identifying significant multivariate linear associations using MaAsLin [13] (Fig. 3, Additional file 6: Table S3). This model associates microbial clade or pathway abundances with metadata of interest (for example, BMI, FBS, triglyceride) while accounting for other covariates (in this case sex, smoking, age, and the twin pairing; see Methods and Additional file 7: Figure S4). The abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila was negatively correlated with BMI, FBS, and insulin levels, for example, all in gradients ranging continuously over the ranges of these clinical variables and its relative abundance. This mucin-degrading microbe has been observed to be reduced in the guts of obese mice [30], pregnant women [10, 11], and overweight children [9], but this is the first time this trend has been observed in non-pregnant adults, especially within the normal range of BMI and FBS. This suggests the organism may represent one aspect of the obese gut microbiome that may be of specifically sub-clinical significance.
                      Fig. 3
                        Selected significant associations of clinical markers with clade and pathway abundances. Lines represent linear model fit after transform to accommodate compositional, non-normally distributed data (see Methods) and account for age, sex, smoking, and twin relationships as covariates. Nominal P values and FDR corrected q-values are assigned by MaAsLin [13]. See Additional file 5: Figure S3 for complete list of significant associations
                      , Other continuous associations of clades with phenotypes included a positive correlation between the Bacteroides genus and BMI, again spanning a range of the latter outside of clinical obesity. The Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio is one of the earliest features of the gut microbiome suggested to associate with obesity in mice [31], but in this and other studies [11, 32, 33] associating an increase in Bacteroidetes with obesity rather than an increase in Firmicutes. Both positive and negative associations with the Bacteroidetes have been found in human populations [34], suggesting that this finding is not generalizable and depends greatly on factors that may include the underlying demographics, diet, sample preparation, and analysis (see Discussion)., We found multiple associations between microbial molecular function and clinical phenotypes (Fig. 3, Additional file 6: Table S3), including an increase in riboflavin-, NAD-, and tetrahydrofolate-biosynthesis and a decrease in pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase accompanying increasing BMI levels (Fig. 3). Riboflavin and NAD are both required for the biosynthesis of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) [35], an important antioxidant that alleviates the damage done by reactive oxygen species, and indeed we found that glutathione biosynthesis also increased at higher BMI levels (Additional file 6: Table S3). The direction of these associations suggests that the gut microbiota is producing more glutathione, and potentially processing more from the host, to relieve the increased oxidative stress at high levels of BMI., Besides the gradient associations discussed above, we also identified two unusual threshold-like associations: BMI with Eubacterium siraeum and blood pressure with Methanobrevibacter smithii. In both these cases, the microbe is present only below a certain threshold (22.5 BMI, and 70 diastolic blood pressure, respectively). Interestingly, these trends do not appear in data collected for the human microbiome project (Additional file 8: Figure S5) and maybe unique to our cohort. Such discrete associations can be very interesting to investigate further, to potentially reveal the mechanism underlying the microbeâs sensing of host conditions., To better understand the relation between the taxonomic compositional profiles and function, we correlated the profiles of each clade with the profiles of each module (Fig. 4, selected individual scatter plots appear in Additional file 9: Figure S6). This allows us to hypothesize which microbes contribute to, depend on, or associate with specific metabolic and biomolecular processes carried out by the gut microbiota. In particular, a positive correlation between a module and microbe can have two explanations. In some cases, the function may be encoded in the microbeâs genome (referred to as âdirectly encodedâ correlations, Additional file 10: Figure S7A). Alternatively, a microbe might correlate with a function not because it carries it itself, but because it associates with other microbes that encode it (âindirectly associatedâ correlations). The former indicates microbes that perform a particular molecular process, the latter those that depend on its presence elsewhere in the community.
                      Fig. 4
                        Association of taxa with microbial metabolic modules. The relative abundances of 56 total species were Spearman correlated against those of 87 functional profiles to identify covariation between taxa and metabolic modules (either due to genetic carriage or shared environment). Pluses and stars indicate nominal P value <0.01 or FDR q-value <0.2, respectively. Yellow marks indicate correlations also found in the corresponding analysis of HMP data [21] (see Additional file 11: Figure S8). Highlighted boxes are discussed in the main text
                      , As expected, many âencodedâ correlations are found in our data and each of them induces others that are âassociatedâ, based on the species co-occurrence network as computed using Spearman correlation (Additional file 10: Figure S7B). One interesting âencodedâ example is a set of archaeal functions, such as coenzyme M biosynthesis and archaeal RNA polymerase and ribosome, correlated with the archaeal species Methanobrevibacter smithii and Methanosphaera stadtmanae (Fig. 4 Box A). Correspondingly, we found âassociatedâ correlations between these archaeal functions and the abundance of Deltaproteobacteria, Akkermansia muciniphila and Eubacterium siraeum, which co-occur with the archaeal species in our data (Fig. 4 Box A; Additional file 10: Figure S7B Box A). We do not yet know why particularly these microbes would tend to share the archaeal environment, but it is interesting to examine if this relationship holds in other cohorts as well., Additionally, three metal transport systems (TSs) were correlated with specific taxa. The manganese/zinc/iron TS M00319 is an ABC transporter, comprising four proteins, found originally in Treponema pallidum [36], and this specific TS is encoded only in the Veillonella species in our data. In addition to âencodedâ correlations between this TS and three Veillonella species, we identified two âassociatedâ correlations with Streptococcus salivarius and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, co-occurring species with the Veillonella (Fig. 4 Box B; Additional file 10: Figure S7B Box B). Similarly, the cobalt/nickel TS M00245 is another four-protein ABC transporter, estimated to be the most widespread uptake system for the two metals [37]. This module is encoded in many microbial species, and specifically in Eubacterium hallii and Ruminococcus obeum [38] in our communities, resulting in those encoded correlations. These were accompanied by additional âassociatedâ correlations with co-occurring species including Dorea longicatena (Fig. 4 Box C; Additional file 10: Figure S7B Box C). Lastly, two modules involving nickel TSs (cobalt/nickel M00245 and peptide/nickel M00239), together with sugar and amino acid metabolism and TS modules, were âencodedâ correlations found in the Bifidobacterium species. Methionine degradation M00035 was also encoded by these organisms, which generates S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), a major methyl donor in the cell [39], and Bifidobacterium is used outside of the gut as a source of SAM in the functional food industry [40]., This cohortâs microbial co-occurrence network (Additional file 10: Figure S7B) can also explain some of the negative associations found in our data. For example, the abundance of Bacteroides xylanisolvens is negatively correlated with several taxa, including Methanosphaera stadtmanae and Ruminococcus obeum (Additional file 10: Figure S7B Box D), resulting in a negative correlation between these species and modules encoded by B. xylanisolvens, like NAD-, tetrahydrofolate-, and biotin biosynthesis (Fig. 4 Boxes D, E, F). Another example is the negative correlation between Roseburia intestinalis and E. coli (Additional file 10: Figure S7B Box E), resulting in the negative associations between E. coli and the Shikimate pathway, encoded in R. intestinalis genome sequence (Fig. 4 Boxes G, H). Such negative associations can also be the result of conflicting functionalities between certain microbes and metabolic functions not present in their genomes., Interestingly, some correlations are neither âencodedâ nor âassociatedâ, and we can only hypothesize as to their cause. One such example is the correlation between the archaeal functions mentioned above and abundance of Bacteroides fragilis, Odoribacter splanchnicus and Parabacteroides merdae (Fig. 4 Box I). Although these functions are not encoded in any of these genomes, the gene comB (2-phosphosulfolactate phosphatase), which belongs to the coenzyme M biosynthesis module, is encoded in the genome of Parabacteroides merdae [38], potentially explaining this association. Such a correlation might arise due to these organismsâ metabolic dependence on a function encoded by diverse organisms in different hosts., Another interesting example is the positive correlation between riboflavin biosynthesis and the abundance of Bacteroides xylanisolvens (Fig. 4 Box E). As discussed above, we found several compositional and functional associations with BMI, including Bacteroides, riboflavin-, NAD-, and tetrahydrofolate- biosynthesis. Indeed, the latter two are âencodedâ correlations with B. xylanisolvens, suggesting that the increase in this species abundance in higher levels of BMI is contributing to the increase in NAD- and tetrahydrofolate- biosynthesis. Additionally, riboflavin biosynthesis may also be an âencodedâ association of B. xylanisolvens and we failed to identify it as such, potentially due to the incompleteness of current functional databases., Finally, additional âencodedâ correlations were found between various amino acid transport systems and E. coli (Fig. 4 Box K). Many of these were detected in at least some strains of E. coli, due to the combination of E. coliâs very large pan-genome and the extent to which its strain variation space is well-covered by the many available reference genomes. Many of these correlations, like all of this cohortâs microbe-function correlations, were also found in the HMP [21] (yellow marks in Fig. 4, and Additional file 11: Figure S8). This suggests both that simple âencodedâ correlations recur across populations, as expected, and that more subtle âassociatedâ microbial dependencies may be consistent among diverse gut ecologies., Several studies have observed that related individuals, and particularly twins, carry more similar microbial communities than do unrelated individuals [6], and we reproduce this finding in our cohort (Fig. 1d). However, it has not been previously determined whether this similarity is due to ecological pressures that select for similar microbes among individuals, dispersal effects that cause the acquisition of identical microbes, or other factors. In cases where twins in this study shared similar taxonomic profiles and identical species, we thus tested whether these species were of the same strain. Defining microbial clades at genus-, species-, or strain- level is a difficult task [11, 41], and here we chose to define a strain as a combination of genomic markers, allowing us to identify dominant, near-clonal populations. Microbes were strain-typed within samples by identifying conserved or differential patterns of unique mobile element loss and gain using MetaPhlAn (see Methods), which has previously been successful in differentiating strains among individuals and over time [21, 42]. In particular, individuals were shown in these previous analyses to often carry a single dominant strain of most species [42] and for that strain to be significantly stable over time [14, 21] (Additional file 12: Figure S9). Applying this method to our data allowed us to determine: (1) when twins shared the same strain, in addition to the same species; and (2) when these strains were retained within an individual over time., Remarkably, twins were not significantly more similar than unrelated in their strain composition (Pâ=â0.15 by t-test), although (as expected) samples from the same individual over time were significantly similar (Pâ=â1.34e-7; Fig. 5a). This suggests that either there is a genetic tendency for twins to retain broadly similar microbial compositions - but that this does not extend exert selective pressure at the strain level - or that identical strains acquired earlier in life during colonization have, by adulthood, evolved sufficiently to differ at multiple genomic elements. Only in rare cases did strains differ within individuals over time (Additional file 13: Figure S10), concordant with occasional sweeps of a replacement strain due to, for example, gene acquisition/loss or transfer from an external source.

                      , We quantified the degree to which each microbial species was represented by the same or different strains among twins, specifically by calculating for each microbe the mean distance across genomic elements of all sample pair-wise comparisons (Additional file 14: Figure S11, see Methods). While some species retained very similar strains among twins (for example, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Fig. 5b), others consistently had more distinct strains (for example, Prevotella copri, Fig. 5c). While this detailed analysis is only possible in microbes that are particularly abundant in multiple samples, it raises the intriguing possibility that identical strains acquired early in life persist in the gut, but evolve rapidly through the gain and loss of genetic elements., Here, we analyzed metagenomes from 36 fecal samples drawn from healthy Korean MZ twins over time, identifying associations between T2D-related biomarkers (for example, BMI, FBS) and microbial clades and functions. We found, among other examples, that BMI was negatively correlated with the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and positively correlated with riboflavin and NAD biosynthesis. These associations occurred over both the pre- and post-onset range of T2D clinical markers, suggesting that the microbiota may contribute to or react to changes in the host environment prior to the onset of disease. Furthermore, functional changes in the gut microbiome at higher sub-clinical values of BMI, FBS, and triglycerides resembled the signatures found in patients with established IBD or T2D, suggesting a shared response to oxidative stress in the gut, induced even at low levels of inflammation or immune activation. Finally, we found that while twins were more similar than unrelated individuals in microbial composition, they often carried different strains of these species. The computational framework presented here can be easily applied to other MZ twin cohorts, identifying early microbial markers of various other diseases, even in their sub-clinical phase., Obesity and metabolic syndrome have long been associated with chronic, low-grade inflammation [43]. For example, macrophages of obese individuals accumulate in adipose tissue, where they express pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa, IL6, and INOS [44], and the gut microbiota can initiate the inflammation and insulin resistance associated with obesity [34]. Interestingly, although there was no indication of host inflammation in our data (as measured by hsCRP), we observed the microbiome responding to this in the form of decreased abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and increased NAD- and riboflavin-biosynthesis. This collection of functional changes together specifically enables the recharging of glutathione to its reduced form, promoting redox homeostasis in microbes potentially exposed to an increasingly hostile, inflammatory, oxidatively stressed environment the gut., It is likely that additional compositional and functional shifts accompany this low-grade inflammation in T2D and related conditions, which will be better detected in other, larger cohorts capturing an even broader range of phenotypes and disease states. Finding common microbial changes is an important step towards understanding the cross talk between the gut microbiota and the diseased host, but whether these shifts are causal, responsive, or both remains an open question. For example, the microbial response to redox stress is more likely to be reactive, but microbes that are robust to this environment may promote its maintenance and thus contribute to immune activation or obesity. A combination of interventions in model systems and longitudinal prospective cohort studies of high-risk individuals, identifying the microbial changes that occur before the onset and during the early progression of the diseases, will enable us to determine whether the microbial shifts trigger host symptoms, or vice versa, and potentially by what specific molecular mechanisms., This pattern of microbial functional enrichments during inflammation has now been consistent across multiple studies regardless of their potential causality, including in other diseases like IBD (Fig. 6), suggesting a common signature of gut response to low-grade inflammation. Interestingly, several studies have examined whether inflammation can lead to obesity [45â47] and T2D [48â50] in mice, finding that inflammation drives the development of insulin resistance (potentially through the phosphorylation of insulin receptor 1 by a TNF-Î± mediated response [51]) and suggesting that particular intestinal microbial configurations can promote immune responses driving metabolic dysfunction [51]. The extent to which the gut microbiota causes obesity is an area of active research. Many mouse models, including Lep
                        ob
                , consistently demonstrate an elevated Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes (F:B) ratio in obese animals [5, 31]. In contrast, in human cohorts, the relationship has been much less consistent. The relationship between obesity and the F:B ratio has been reported as increased [5, 8], decreased [34], and others have reported no relationship [21, 52], indicating there is still great variability in current studies. This may arise either from technical issues, like different sample or data handling protocols, or from biological reasons, like true variation between the various cohorts.
                    Fig. 6
                      Microbial functional dysbioses common among this study and the gut microbiome in IBD and T2D. Several microbial metabolic pathways were determined to be significantly enriched (red) or depleted (green) relative to the obesity-related clinical markers collected in our study (KTwin) and in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD [13]) and/or type 2 diabetes (T2D [3]). Directionality of association in these common dysbioses was near-uniformly consistent, as indicated by box color
                    , Many microbial genes, particularly housekeeping genes, are transcribed at a basal level, and thus their measured DNA and RNA levels are well-correlated. In contrast, other classes of genes such as vitamin and amino acid biosynthesis are much more dynamically regulated, so DNA and RNA levels are less correlated [53]. While this study measured only DNA abundance of genes, concurrent examination of the subclinical biomarker meta-transcriptome would be an informative extension of this work., Finally, a unique dataset comprising shotgun metagenomes of MZ twins over time enabled us to find that although twins are more similar in their species composition, they often harbor different strains. This unexpected discrepancy between the microbial population structures of strains versus species in the human microbiome should be further explored, as it can be explained by a variety of very distinct ecological and molecular hypotheses. Hosts with similar genetic profiles may exert a modest but continuous selective pressure for the acquisition and maintenance of similar species in the gut, which could be tested by collecting data on the degree of shared early life and persistent environment versus genetics. Alternatively, initially identical strains acquired from a shared environment, possibly in early life, may be maintained but diverge through fixation of genetic drift and laterally transferred elements over time. Occasional strain differences within the same individual over time suggest a fast divergence rate; however, a larger study, with temporally dense sampling of both adults and infants, will be needed to address this question., To conclude, this study provides evidence of low-grade inflammation of the gut with increasing values of obesity- and T2D-related biomarkers. Compositional and functional microbial signatures indicate the presence of sub-clinical inflammation in adults increasingly at risk of these conditions, even before they are reflected by clinical markers. If these microbial shifts play a causal role in the onset of obesity or T2D, they may represent not only novel markers for early diagnosis, but also a target for preventative therapeutic intervention. Even if these shifts are not ultimately the primary causal agents behind their associated diseases, microbial dysbioses may still be manipulated to avert disease onset, and their specifics are likely to improve our mechanistic understanding of host-microbiota interaction and its role in disease prevention and treatment.,

                Background
                Nuclease-based technologies have been developed that enable targeting of specific DNA sequences directly in the zygote. These approaches provide an opportunity to modify the genomes of inbred mice, and allow the removal of strain-specific mutations that confound phenotypic assessment. One such mutation is the Cdh23

                We have used targeted CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology directed repair (HDR) to correct the Cdh23

                   allele directly in C57BL/6NTac zygotes. Employing offset-nicking Cas9 (D10A) nickase with paired RNA guides and a single-stranded oligonucleotide donor template we show that allele repair was successfully achieved. To investigate potential Cas9-mediated âoff-targetâ mutations in our corrected mouse, we undertook whole-genome sequencing and assessed the âoff-targetâ sites predicted for the guide RNAs (â¤4 nucleotide mis-matches). No induced sequence changes were identified at any of these sites.
                Correction of the progressive hearing loss phenotype was demonstrated using auditory-evoked brainstem response testing of mice at 24 and 36 weeks of age, and rescue of the progressive loss of sensory hair cell stereocilia bundles was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy of dissected cochleae from 36-week-old mice.

The corrected mice described in this report will allow age-related auditory phenotyping studies to be undertaken using C57BL/6NTac-derived models, such as those generated by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) programme., The most common form of sensory disability in the human population is age-related hearing loss (ARHL), which not only causes communication difficulties, but also is associated with social isolation, depression and reduced physical and cognitive function [1]. ARHL is known to be a complex disorder with both genetic and environmental components. Given the high prevalence of the condition (>60 % of people aged â¥70 years), coupled with an ageing population, there is a drive to elucidate the genes and pathology associated with ARHL, thus enabling the development of potential therapeutic strategies. To date, several major genetic studies have investigated adult hearing function in humans, providing candidate gene sets for ARHL susceptibility factors [2â6]. However, the lack of genome-wide significance and absence of replication between studies means validation of these candidate ARHL genes in a model organism is required., The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) aims to produce knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome and test each mutant line through a broad-based phenotyping pipeline, in order to elaborate upon the function of every mouse gene [7, 8]. IMPC uses mutant embryonic stem cells developed by the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC). The mice generated by the IMPC are preserved in repositories and are available to the scientific community. Utilisation of knockout mice generated by this programme would provide a relatively quick and cost-effective way to obtain models for the validation of genes arising from the human ARHL studies, and to assess the role of genes in ARHL., A main strength of the IKMC and IMPC programmes is that the respective embryonic stem cell resource and knockout mice produced are generated in a single inbred strain background, namely C57BL/6NTac. However, a major genetic impact of the use of C57BL/6N and the related C57BL/6J strain is that they harbour a fixed hypomorphic allele in the Cadherin23 gene (Cdh23
                        ahl
                ) that causes these mice to exhibit a high-frequency hearing loss by 3â6 months of age that progresses to a profound impairment by 15 months of age [9, 10]. This renders C57BL/6NTac an unsuitable background strain for investigating potential ARHL-causing genes., Over recent years several technologies have been developed that allow targeting of specific DNA sequences directly in the zygote, e.g. zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9). These are nuclease-based approaches which generate DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) at user-defined genomic sequences. The presence of a DSB initiates a repair mechanism that typically leads to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), resulting in insertion or deletion (indels) events at the targeted locus. However, if the nucleases are used in conjunction with a donor DNA sequence carrying the desired insert with flanking homology to the targeted region, integration by homology directed repair (HDR) can occur. Recently, Low et al. [11] successfully corrected the Crb1
                        rd8
                 mutation directly in C57BL/6N zygotes using a TALEN-mediated HDR approach, showing recovery of a normal retinal phenotype in heterozygous repaired animals., Here, we describe the use of targeted CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR to correct the Cdh23
                        ahl
                 allele directly in C57BL/6NTac zygotes. Using two different designs, both employing offset-nicking Cas9 (D10A) nickase with paired RNA guides and a single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssODN) as donor template, we show that allele repair was successfully achieved., Importantly, we demonstrate that unlike inbred C57BL/6NTac mice (Cdh23
                        ahl/ahl
                ), the heterozygous Cdh23 repair mice (Cdh23
                        ahl/753A>G
                ) have normal hearing thresholds and a full complement of cochlear sensory hair cell stereocilia bundles at 36 weeks of age. Thus, the repaired C57BL/6NTac mice described here provide an enhanced defined genetic background in which IMPC knockout mouse models can be generated, which are suitable for both assessment of age-related auditory function and age-related behavioural studies that utilize acoustic stimuli as part of the test paradigm., All animals were housed and maintained in the Mary Lyon Centre, MRC Harwell under specific opportunistic pathogen-free (SOPF) conditions, in individually ventilated cages adhering to environmental conditions as outlined in the Home Office Code of Practice. All animal studies were licensed by the Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations 2012 (SI 4 2012/3039), UK, and additionally approved by the Institutional Ethical Review Committee. Mice were euthanized by Home Office Schedule 1 methods., The sequences of all single-stranded oligonucleotides are presented in Additional file 1: Table S1. All constructs were checked using Sanger sequencing (SourceBioscience)., A pair of ssODNs containing two unique restriction sites, StuI and AflII (T7GibsonF and T7GibsonR, Integrated DNA Technologies) was annealed and cloned into linearised gRNA_Cloning Vector (Addgene, 41824; George Church, Harvard) digested with PvuI and AflII, using Gibson Assembly Master Mix (New England BioLabs (NEB)). As a result, the new restriction sites have been integrated between the T7 promoter and the single guide RNA (sgRNA) backbone sequence, and can be used to linearise the plasmid for further cloning of chosen protospacer sequences., Cas9 mutant D10A nickase sequence was PCR amplified from pX335 plasmid (Addgene, 42335; Feng Zhang, MIT) using high fidelity Expand Long Range dNTPack (Roche) and oligonucleotides Cas9f4gibson/Cas9r4gibson (Sigma-Aldrich). The PCR product was cloned using Gibson Assembly Master Mix (NEB) into linearised p_1.1 plasmid digested with StuI and AflII in order to express Cas9 mutant D10A under the T7 promoter., For each sgRNA (Cdh23_U1, U2 and D1), a pair of ssODNs (Sigma-Aldrich; forward 5â²-TAATACGACTCACTATAGG-protospacer-3â²; reverse 5â²-GACTAGCCTTATTTTAACTTGCTATTTCTAGCTCTAAAAC-protospacer antisense-3â²) was hybridised and cloned using Gibson Assembly Master Mix (NEB) into linearised p_1.1 plasmid digested with StuI and AflII in order to express sgRNAs under the T7 promoter., Cas9 mutant D10A nickase mRNA and sgRNAs were in vitro transcribed from linear forms of p_1.3_D10A and p_1.1_sgRNA plasmids, respectively. Plasmids were linearised with XbaI and phenol-chloroform purified. mRNA was synthesised using Message Max T7 Arca Capped Message Transcription Kit (Cellscript) and poly-adenylated using poly(A) polymerase Tailing Kit (Epicentre). Single-stranded guide RNAs were synthesised using MEGAshortscript (Ambion)., RNAs were purified using MEGAclear kit (Ambion). RNA quality was assessed using a NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific) and by electrophoresis on 2 % agarose gel containing Ethidium Bromide (Fisher Scientific)., In vitro efficacy of each in vitro transcribed sgRNA (U1, U2 and D1) was assessed using the Guide-itTM sgRNA Screening kit (Clontech) following the manufacturerâs instructions. Analysis of the enzymatic digestions were analysed by electrophoresis on 1.5 % agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (Fisher Scientific)., Pronuclear microinjection was performed as per Gardiner and Teboul [12], employing a FemtojJet (Eppendorf) and C57BL/6NTac embryos. Specifically, injection pressure (Pi) was set between 100 and 700 hPa, depending on needle opening; injection time (Ti) was set at 0.5 seconds and the compensation pressure (PC) was set at 10 hPa., Microinjection buffer (MIB; 10 mM TrisâHCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, pH7.5) was prepared and filtered through a 2 nm filter and autoclaved. Cas9 mutant D10A nickase mRNA, sgRNAs and ssODNs were diluted and mixed in MIB to the working concentrations of 200 or 100 ng/Î¼l, 100 or 50 ng/Î¼l each and 40 or 20 ng/Î¼l, respectively. Injected embryos were re-implanted in CD1 pseudo-pregnant females. Host females were allowed to litter and rear F0 progeny., Genomic DNA from F0 and F1 animals was extracted from ear clip biopsies using a DNA Extract All Reagents Kit (Applied Biosystems). The targeted region was PCR amplified using high fidelity Expand Long Range dNTPack (Roche) and genotyping primers Geno_Cdh23_F1/R1 or F2/R2. PCR products were further purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and analysed by Sanger sequencing., PCR products amplified from DNA obtained from F0 animals that showed mixed sequencing traces were sub-cloned using a Zero-Blunt PCR cloning Kit (Invitrogen) and 12â24 clones per founder were analysed by Sanger sequencing., Genomic DNA was prepared from the spleen of the F0 mouse that gave rise to the ârepairedâ line that underwent auditory phenotyping. Phenol-chloroform extracted DNA was assessed using a NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific), Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek) and by electrophoresis on 1.5 % agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (Fisher Scientific). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencer. The sequence was mapped using: the BWA-mem aligner with default parameters, v.0.7.10; mouse genome reference mm10 from UCSC (original GRCm38 from NCBI, January 2012); base Phred quality cutoff, NA; keep duplicate reads, no; variable read length support, yes; and, realign gaps, no. Sequence variants were called by The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) [13]. The BAM file was realigned for indel calling by Indel realigner. Indels were called by GATKâs HaplotypeCaller and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were called by GATKâs UnifiedGenotyper, both using dbSNP version 137 as the background single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set. SNV annotations were done using NGS-SNP [14]. Indels were annotated using The Variant Effect Predictor [15]., SNVs and indels were then compared against the precompiled list found in 18 inbred strains from the Mouse Genome Project [16]. Further filtering was done by comparing the novel sequence variations with a wild-type (WT) C57BL/6NTac mouse genome and other in-house mouse sequences. Only high confidence sequence variations were considered in this study. High confidence SNVs and indels refer to those with Phred base quality >150 and read depth >3., Coding SNVs were investigated by PCR amplification (primers are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1) and Sanger sequencing of DNA from the F0 and four C57BL/6NTac WT animals, including that of a stud male employed to produce the microinjected embryos., Genomic DNA from F1 animals was extracted from ear clips using a DNA Extract All Reagents Kit (Applied Biosystems). Potential off-target sites predicted by the WTSI Genome Editing (WGE) webtool for sgRNA_U1 and sgRNA_D1 (design 1), and containing â¤3 mismatches (Additional file 1: Table S2) were PCR amplified using High fidelity Expand Long Range dNTPack (Roche) and the corresponding genotyping primers (Additional file 1: Table S3). PCR amplicons were gel-purified (QIAGEN) and analysed by Sanger sequencing., Genomic DNA from F0 and F1 animals was extracted from ear clips using DNA Extract All Reagents Kit (Applied Biosystems). Reaction mixtures (20 Î¼l) contained 1 Î¼l crude DNA lysate, 1Ã ddPCR Supermix for probes (Bio-Rad), 225 nM of each primer (two primers per assay used; Additional file 1: Table S1) and 50 nM of each probe (one VIC-labeled probe for the reference gene assay and one FAM-labeled Taqman assay specific to the ssODN_U1 sequence, designed by Biosearch Technologies). These were loaded into the Bio-Rad QX200 AutoDG and droplets generated as per the manufacturerâs instructions. After droplet generation, the oil/reagent emulsion was transferred to a 96-well plate (Eppendorf) and the samples were amplified (95 Â°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94 Â°C for 30 s and 58 Â°C for 60 s, with a final elongation step of 98 Â°C for 10 min). The plate containing the droplet amplicons was analysed as a CNV2 experiment in a QX200 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad), with channel 1 as unknown and channel 2 as the two-copy reference assay. Standard reagents and consumables supplied by Bio-Rad were used, including cartridges and gaskets, droplet generation oil and droplet reader oil. Analysis was performed using Quantasoft software (Bio-Rad) and copy number determined using a minimum of 10,000 partitions for each sample., Auditory-evoked brainstem response (ABR) testing was performed as previously described by Hardisty-Hughes et al. [17]. Briefly, mice were anaesthetised using a mixture of ketamine and xylazine and placed on a heated mat in an acoustic chamber (ETS-Lindgren). Broadband click and tone-burst stimuli (8 kHz, 16 kHz, and 32 kHz) were presented free field to the right ear of the mouse. TDT system III hardware and software (Tucker Davis Technology) were used for stimulus presentation and response averaging, starting at the highest level (90 dB sound pressure level (SPL)) and reducing in 5 or 10 dB increments until no response trace could be observed. Mice that displayed no response to a 90 dB SPL stimulus were recorded as 100 dB SPL for subsequent analysis. Recovery of anaesthetized mice was assisted by Atipamezole., Animals were euthanized and excised inner ears were fixed overnight in 2.5 % gluteraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). Fixed ears were decalcified for 48 hours in 4.3 % EDTA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich). Fine dissection was performed to reveal the organ of Corti, before osmium tetroxide (Agar Scientific)âthiocarbohydrazide (Fluka) processing (adapted from Hunter-Duvar [18]) was carried out. The inner ears were then dehydrated through increasing strength ethanol solutions (Fisher Scientific) and critical point dried using an Emitech K850 (EM Technologies Ltd). The specimens were then mounted on stubs using silver paint (Agar Scientific) and sputter coated with platinum using a Quorum Q150R S sputter coater (Quorum Technologies). Prepared cochlea were visualised with a JEOL LSM-6010 (Jeol Ltd) scanning electron microscope. Hair cell stereocilia bundle counts were performed by counting the number of adjacent inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs) to ten pillar cells. For the analysis the cochlea was divided into three separate regions (turns), apical (<180Â° from apex), mid (180â450Â° from apex), and basal (450â630Â° from apex). Four ears (one ear per mouse) were analysed for each genotype at each region., The Cdh23
                           ahl
                   allele is a synonymous SNP affecting the last nucleotide of the seventh coding exon of the Cdh23 gene (c.753). The presence of an adenine (A) rather than a guanine (G) at this position leads to an increased frequency of exon 7 skipping, predisposing inbred mouse strains carrying the A allele to age-related hearing loss [19]. Our strategy for correcting this allele involved directly injecting CRISPR reagents into one-cell stage mouse embryos. This approach has previously been shown to introduce subtle modifications into the genome at high efficiency [20, 21]. Given reported concerns regarding the specificity of the Cas9 nuclease and potential off-target effects, we opted to use paired offset guides along with a nickase version (D10A) of the Cas9 protein to correct the B6N.Cdh23
                           ahl
                   allele [22, 23]., Employing the Zhang Lab CRISPR design tool (http://crispr.mit.edu/), three protospacers (sgRNA_U1, sgRNA_U2 and sgRNA_D1) were selected allowing for two different designs (design 1, U1/D1, +42 nucleotide offset; and design 2, U2/D1, +13 nucleotide offset) (Fig. 1). The criteria for protospacer sequence selection was based on the following previously suggested recommendations: double nicking resulting in 5â² overhang; low potential off-target effects; as close as possible to the targeted nucleotide; and a short offset [22, 24]. In vitro assessment of these sgRNAs revealed that sgRNA_U1 and sgRNA_D1 both have a high efficacy for directing Cas9 nuclease activity (85 % and 88 % cleavage, respectively), whereas sgRNA_U2 has a lower efficacy (30 %) (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). As such, while design 1 employs two very efficient sgRNAs, the large offset will likely reduce the overall efficiency of this design. In comparison, for design 2 the offset distance is within the optimum range (â4 to +20), but it employs a less efficient sgRNA that will reduce the overall efficiency of this second design [22]. Each design required a specific 121 bp ssODN to be synthesised with the desired correction (A > G) at their centre; these act as DNA donor templates for HDR. In addition to the Cdh23
                           ahl
                   allele correction, both ssODN templates also contain substitutions in the region complementary to the protospacer sequences (AG > TC in ssODN_U1 and C > T in ssODN_U2). These additional substitutions were added to prevent further modification by the CRISPR/Cas9 post HDR repair. In design 1, the AG > TC substitution does not change the encoded residue (AGT > TCT, Ser > Ser), and in design 2 the C > T substitution is within the intron (Fig. 1).

                           allele with an arrow, and two base changes shown in red text. The two synonymous base substitutions are designed to prevent further modification by the CRISPR/Cas9 following repair. The corrected Cdh23

                           allele is the allele found in inbred mouse strains that do not demonstrate age-related hearing loss (ARHL). The final corrected Cdh23
                                       753A>G(U1)
                           gene sequence closely matches that found in these non-ARHL inbred strains at the nucleotide level, except for the two synonymous base substitutions (c.724A > T and c.725G > C; red text). The Cdh23
                                       753A>G(U1)
                           product is predicted to be identical to the Cdh23 protein found in non-ARHL mouse strains. b Design 2 also utilises a 121 bp ssODN (ssODN_U2) in combination with two single guide RNAs, sgRNA_D1 also used in design 1 and sgRNA_U2, which lies across the Cdh23
                                       ahl
                           locus. The full ssODN_U2 donor sequence is shown below the C57BL/6NTac Cdh23

                                       753A>G(U2)
                           gene sequence is identical to that found in non-ARHL inbred strains at the nucleotide level, with only an intronic base substitution (c.753 + 9c > t; red text). The Cdh23
                                       753A>G(U2)

                      , For each experimental design, in vitro transcribed Cas9 (D10A) nickase mRNA, two sgRNAs and one ssODN were co-injected into one-cell-stage mouse embryos. To optimise the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR, we varied the concentration of these reagents such that we used a âlowâ and a âhighâ concentration for each of the two designs (Table 1). For design 1, the percentage of survival (born/injected) was lower when using the higher concentration. However, this likely reflects the smaller number of embryos injected with the lower concentration, as no difference in survival was noted for design 2 when altering concentration (Table 1). Using design 1, a total of 244 embryos were injected over three microinjection sessions giving rise to 72 live founder (F0) pups (29.5 %). Whereas, using design 2 a total of 212 embryos were injected over two microinjection sessions, giving rise to 32 live F0 pups (15.1 %).Table 1

                         repair using pronuclear injection of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents. For designs 1 and 2, two sets of injections were performed using either 100, 50, 50 and 20 ng/Î¼l or 200, 100, 100 and 40 ng/Î¼l of Cas9 (D10A) nickase mRNA, sgRNAs_U, sgRNA_D and ssODN, respectively. Higher efficiency was obtained when using the higher concentrations. The percentages of mutation rate and legitimate repair rate have both been calculated using the number of pups born as the denominator
                    , To identify CRISPR-mediated events within the 104 F0 pups, DNA extracted from ear biopsies was utilised for PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of the targeted locus. Animals with a complex genotype (i.e. mosaic with two or more mutated alleles) or potentially harbouring the correctly repaired allele were further characterised by sub-cloning and Sanger sequencing of the targeted region. Of the 72 F0 pups generated using design 1, 11 were found mutated on-target, including two containing the repaired Cdh23
                           753A>G
                   allele. For design 2, 4 of the 32 F0 pups were found mutated on-target, including two containing the repaired Cdh23
                           753A>G
                   allele. Interestingly, in addition to the repaired Cdh23
                           753A>G
                   allele, these animals were also carrying alleles incorrectly repaired through HDR (which we called âillegitimate repairâ) (Fig. 2). Thus, from a total of 456 injected embryos we recovered 104 pups (22.8 %), 15 of which are transgenic (14.4 %), including four carrying the correct Cdh23
                           753A>G
                  repair (3.8 %) (Table 1). Interestingly, 14 of the 15 transgenic mice (including the four with the repaired allele) were obtained from microinjections using the higher concentration of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents, while only one transgenic mouse was produced using the lower concentration.

                        Targeting events in F0 mice and transmission to F1 offspring. a Targeting events in an F0 using design 1. The genotype of the F0 was directly assessed by ear clip DNA analysis. This revealed the presence of two alleles: allele 1 corresponding to the legitimate HDR event and allele 2 corresponding to the WT allele. The genotype of the F0 animal was confirmed through the transmission of both alleles to the F1 population, several of which were identified as heterozygous for the legitimate repair (see trace). b Targeting events in an F0 using design 2. The genotype of the F0 was directly assessed by ear clip DNA analysis. This revealed the presence of three alleles: allele 1 corresponding to an NHEJ event consisting of a 24 nucleotide deletion; allele 2 corresponding to a combination of the intended repair and additional sequence changes (illegitimate repair) comprising modification of the two targeted nucleotides and a 3â² deletion of 24 nucleotides; and allele 3 corresponding to a legitimate repair. The genotype of the F0 animal was confirmed through transmission of these three alleles to the F1 population (F1 allele 1 and F1 allele 2). However, one additional allele was also identified in the F1 population: âF1 allele 4â comprising WT sequence
                      , The four F0 mice identified as having the correctly repaired Cdh23
                           753A>G
                   allele were shown to be highly mosaic at the target region. To further characterise the alleles present in these mice, PCR amplification of the targeted locus was undertaken, and the resulting amplicons were sub-cloned and Sanger sequenced. This confirmed that the four F0 mice had undergone CRISPR/Cas9-mediated repair of the Cdh23
                           ahl
                   allele, all showing legitimate repair sequences (Fig. 2). Going forward, this experimental design can be employed to repair the Cdh23

                   allele in other mouse strains, e.g. C57BL/6J., To establish heritability of the repaired Cdh23

                   allele and to segregate the alleles detected in mosaic founders, three of the Cdh23
                           753A>G
                   F0 mice were bred to stock C57BL/6NTac mice., Analysis of the F1 offspring obtained from each of these three founders revealed transmission of the repaired Cdh23
                           753A>G
                   allele (Fig. 2a)., However, analysis of the F1 generation also demonstrated that alleles represented in F0 somatic cells (e.g. an ear biopsy) can be absent, or under-represented, in F0 germ cells, as determined by their non-transmission to the F1 progeny. In addition, the reciprocal can occur where alleles not detected within the somatic cells of a F0 mouse are identified in their F1 progeny. This latter case was observed for both of our design 2 founder mice, which transmitted an additional WT allele not previously detected at the F0 stage (Fig. 2b). These data highlight three important issues associated with CRISPR-aided mutagenesis: firstly, while F0 mice may give initial insight into phenotypic outcomes of CRISPR/Cas9 targeting, they are genotypically unpredictable due to potential mosaicism â therefore, more detailed studies should be undertaken using â¥ F1 animals; secondly, analysis of F1 mice may identify âhiddenâ alleles not seen in the somatic cells of F0 mice; and thirdly, it is important to sequence the flanking regions when producing point mutations by CRISPR-aided mutagenesis to confirm that targeted mutations are not associated with unwanted indels., A major concern within the research community regarding CRISPR/Cas9 technology is the potential for âoff-targetâ events to occur, as these could cause deleterious/confounding phenotypic traits [25, 26]. In order to increase the specificity of our system we decided to use the Cas9 mutant (D10A) double nicking system, which has been proposed to reduce the likelihood of âoff-targetâ mutations [24]. Moreover, the sgRNAs used in this study were specifically selected as they show very few potential off-target sites, particularly on chromosome 10, which could not be easily segregated out through breeding, unlike off-target mutations on other chromosomes. Potential off-target binding sites for the design 1 guides were determined using the WTSI Genome Editing tool [27]. When allowing up to four nucleotide mismatches, 55 and 173 off-target sites were predicted for sgRNA_U1 and sgRNA_D1, respectively (Additional file 1: Table S2). To assess the possibility of off-target Cas9-mediated damage, WGS was performed for the F0 used to establish the line that underwent phenotyping as part of this study. From approximately 152 million paired-end reads (150 bp), the alignment had a 9Ã average read depth with 1.5 % assembly gaps. To enable the identification of CRISPR/Cas9-induced variants we also sequenced a WT C57BL/6NTac from our breeding colony. Sequence variants found to be common between the CRISPR/Cas9 F0, WT C57BL/6NTac, and those variants present in public repositories (including the Mouse Genomes Project and dbSNP [16, 28]) were eliminated from further analysis. Using a standard mutation detection tool we searched for potential sequence variations (SNVs and small indels) in the predicted off-target sites and surrounding the on-target site. No putative SNVs or indels were detected at any of the 228 predicted off-target sites examined (Table 2). Due to the potential of mosaicism within the F0 mouse to confound the WGS data, we also assessed the F1 progeny for the presence of âhiddenâ off-target damage transmitted through the germline. We amplified and Sanger sequenced the 14 most closely related off-target sites (three or fewer mismatches) predicted for sgRNA_U1 and sgRNA_D1 (Additional file 1: Table S3). No sequence variants were identified, confirming the high specificity of the double nicking system. In addition to the Cdh23
                           753A>G
                   repair edit, two additional genome edits were also added as part of design 1 (Fig. 1 and Table 3). All three edits were detected by WGS. To investigate the coding (missense, stop gain/loss and splice) mutation frequency in the F0 repaired Cdh23
                           ahl/753A>G
                   genome, we first used an automated SNV detection pipeline. This identified 42 potential coding SNVs. Subsequently we manually compared these with the WT C57BL/6NTac sequence and other mouse strains from our in-house sequence library. We found the majority of these coding SNVs (41) were present at low allele frequencies in more than two sequences or in regions with misaligned reads, and so were eliminated from further analysis. The one remaining coding SNV and six predicted false positives (randomly selected) were assessed using Sanger sequencing (Table 3). Of these: four SNVs were found not to be present in the repaired Cdh23
                           ahl/753A>G
                   sequence and therefore confirmed as false positives; one SNV (Ubox5) was found to be present in both the WT C57BL/6NTac sequence and the repaired Cdh23
                           ahl/753A>G
                   sequence; one SNV remained undetermined due to the repetitive nature of the genomic locus (Vmn2r114); and one SNV (Fam184b) was found only in the repaired Cdh23
                           ahl/753A>G
                   sequence. Sanger sequencing of additional C57BL/6NTac mice from our WT stock identified that the Fam184b SNV is heterogeneously present, indicating that this mutation has recently arisen spontaneously within the colony (less than ten generations, as the WT C57BL/6NTac colony is restocked every ten generations from the supplier, Taconic Biosciences). This allele on chromosome 5 will be easily segregated from the repaired Cdh23
                           ahl/753A>G

                    , Another reported concern regarding genome editing is the potential for the donor ssODN to randomly incorporate at strand breaks in the genome. To address this possibility we interrogated the F0 WGS data, which only identified the ssODN_U1 sequence at the on-target site. In addition, copy counting of the ssODN_U1 using Droplet Digitalâ¢ PCR was undertaken for this F0 animal and its F1 progeny. This confirmed that the ssODN has only incorporated once within the genome of our repaired mice., The age-related hearing loss observed in C57BL/6 mice (B6J and B6N) has been extensively characterized [10]. The Cdh23

                   hearing loss susceptibility allele (c.753A) carried by these inbred strains cause the mice to develop a high-frequency hearing loss by 3 to 6 months of age that progresses to a profound impairment by 15 months of age. Consistent with the exhibited auditory decline, age-related histopathological changes occur within the ageing cochleae of C57BL/6 mice. It has been shown that loss of sensory hair cell stereocilia bundles begins in the base of the cochlea (the region of the cochlea that detects high-frequency sound) and gradually spreads apically (the region that detects low-frequency sound) with advancing age. While the loss includes both inner and outer hair cell bundles, the loss of outer hair cell bundles precedes and is more extensive than inner hair cell bundle loss [9]., Hearing assessment by ABR threshold analysis was undertaken for wild-type C57BL/6NTac (Cdh23

                   allele in C57BL/6NTac mice and phenotypically rescued their age-related auditory function. The repaired allele is being maintained on a C57BL/6NTac background and available from the Frozen Embryo and Sperm Archive (FESA) at MRC Harwell via MouseBook, an integrated portal of mouse resources [29]., We report the use of offset-nicking CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR to efficiently and precisely correct the Cdh23
                        ahl
                 allele directly in C57BL/6NTac zygotes. Our sequencing data suggest the approach is highly specific, with no lesions identified at any of the predicted off-target sites. Critically, mice heterozygous for the repaired allele maintain normal hearing function, with complete abrogation of both the progressive hearing loss and sensory cell degeneration phenotypes common to the WT C57BL/6NTac strain., It has previously been reported that nuclease-mediated HDR can cause mosaicism in founder animals, and this was found in our F0 mice [30]. The genotypic complexity present in the founder animals precludes definitive phenotypic assessment of these mice and confirms that detailed phenotype data should be acquired from subsequent generations (F1 onwards), once the alleles have been segregated and a precise genotype for each animal is known., The study of mouse mutants, whether induced, engineered, or spontaneous, has been invaluable for the elucidation of genes required for mammalian audition, and remain the model organism of choice. Importantly, characterisation of these models has provided mechanistic insight into the biology of congenital and early-onset hearing loss by elucidating gene function [17, 31]. However, less progress has been made regarding understanding the genetics and pathological processes associated with age-related hearing loss [32]. By crossing to the C57BL/6NTac.Cdh23

                Background
                Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one of the most common healthcare-associated pathogens. To examine the role of inter-hospital patient sharing on MRSA transmission, a previous study collected 2,214 samples from 30 hospitals in Orange County, California and showed by spa typing that genetic differentiation decreased significantly with increased patient sharing. In the current study, we focused on the 986 samples with spa type t008 from the same population.
              
                Methods
                We used genome sequencing to determine the effect of patient sharing on genetic differentiation between hospitals. Genetic differentiation was measured by between-hospital genetic diversity, F
                           ST
                  , and the proportion of nearly identical isolates between hospitals.
              
                Results
                Surprisingly, we found very similar genetic diversity within and between hospitals, and no significant association between patient sharing and genetic differentiation measured by F
                           ST
                  . However, in contrast to F
                           ST
                  , there was a significant association between patient sharing and the proportion of nearly identical isolates between hospitals. We propose that the proportion of nearly identical isolates is more powerful at determining transmission dynamics than traditional estimators of genetic differentiation (F
                           ST
                  ) when gene flow between populations is high, since it is more responsive to recent transmission events. Our hypothesis was supported by the results from coalescent simulations.
              
                Conclusions
                Our results suggested that there was a high level of gene flow between hospitals facilitated by patient sharing, and that the proportion of nearly identical isolates is more sensitive to population structure than F
                           ST
                   when gene flow is high.

                           ST
                  , there was a significant association between patient sharing and the proportion of nearly identical isolates between hospitals. We propose that the proportion of nearly identical isolates is more powerful at determining transmission dynamics than traditional estimators of genetic differentiation (F
                           ST
                  ) when gene flow between populations is high, since it is more responsive to recent transmission events. Our hypothesis was supported by the results from coalescent simulations., Our results suggested that there was a high level of gene flow between hospitals facilitated by patient sharing, and that the proportion of nearly identical isolates is more sensitive to population structure than F
                           ST
                   when gene flow is high., Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a leading cause of hospital-associated infections [1â4], with around 75,000 invasive MRSA infections reported in the United States in 2012 [5]. MRSA colonizes sites including the axilla, groin, gastrointestinal tract, and nares, and is typically spread via skin-to-skin contact, or contaminated medical devices [6, 7]. In hospitalized patients, MRSA causes a wide breadth of infections, including skin and soft-tissue infections, pneumonia, endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, device-associated infections, bacteremia, and sepsis [8]. Risk factors for MRSA infections include previous hospitalization, wounds, invasive medical devices, and immune system impairment [9, 10]., Understanding transmission dynamics within and between hospitals, between community and hospital, and within the community is important for disease control. Transmission-dynamic modeling has suggested that an MRSA outbreak in one facility contributes to MRSA prevalence in other connected healthcare facilities [11â14]. Different scales of genetic data have been used to study within- and/or between- hospital transmission. Ke et al. collected samples from 30 hospitals in Orange County, California and showed by spa typing that genetic differentiation decreases significantly with patient transfer between hospitals [15]. Using genome sequencing data, Long et al. found no evidence of within-hospital transmission between patients with sterile-site infections in four hospitals in Houston [16] and Prosperi et al. reported no phylogeographic clustering of samples from the same hospitals in northeast Florida [17]., The spa typing method involves the sequencing of a polymorphic variable-number tandem repeat within the 3â² coding region of the protein A-encoding gene (spa) and is one of the standard tools for MRSA surveillance studies [18â21]. Protein A binds immunoglobulins, and due to its important function in host-parasite interaction, demographic effects inferred from spa typing can possibly be biased by natural selection. More importantly, it has been suggested that the limited variation in spa typing hampers its power to detect spatial spread over local scales [22â24]. Although Ke et al. [15] successfully identified the effect of patient sharing in a local setting (Orange County, California) using spa typing, with most samples having the same spa type t008, the signal relied on the unusual spa types and might not reflect the overall transmission dynamics. Here, we focused on spa type t008/USA300, the dominant community associated clone in the United States [25â27], and used higher-resolution genome-sequencing data of isolates from the same hospitals as [15, 28] to examine transmission dynamics and the association between genetic differentiation and patient sharing. We compared the power of different tools that characterize genetic differentiation when applied to genome sequencing data of the MRSA population on the county level. We also investigated the factors associated with within- and between-hospital genetic diversity. Our goal was both to assess whether the results of Ke et al. were replicated using genomic data, and to compare measures of population substructure for their ability to detect migration of bacteria â in this case assumed to be via patient transfer from the community and between hospitals â using different kinds of genetic/genomic data., A total of 986 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates assigned as USA300 collected between 2008 and 2010 from 30 hospitals in Orange County, California, USA were selected from a previously published study [15, 28]. Hospitals were instructed to provide isolates from unique patients. The sample sizes and the numbers of hospital- and community-onset isolates are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. An isolate was considered to be hospital-onset if the difference between admission date and the culture date was greater than 2 days. Community-onset in this study includes both true community-onset infections and infections in post-discharge facilities (healthcare-associated community onset (HA-CO)) because we were not able to distinguish them., DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and core genomes were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2000 with 100 bp paired-end reads. Reads were mapped against the USA300 reference sequence FPR3757 (accession NC_007793) using SMALT v0.5.8 (http://âwww.âsanger.âac.âuk/âscience/âtools/âsmalt-0) with subsequent realignment around indels using GATKv1.5.9 [29]. The average depth of reads is 115. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called using samtools and subsequently filtered to remove sites with a quality score less than 50, less than four reads covering the SNP site, and a SNP/mapping quality ratio less than 0.75. SNPs in repeat regions identified using RepeatScout [30] and mobile genetic elements were excluded. This resulted in 24,660 SNPs from the core genome. Sequence data were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (project accession PRJEB2686; for isolate accessions see Additional file 2: Table S2)., Maximum likelihood as implemented in RAxML v0.7.4 [31] with the GTRGAMMA model and 100 bootstrap replications was used to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree of HA-onset isolates. The tree was plotted using iTOL v3.0 [32] and branches and tips were colored according to the hospital where isolates were collected., As in Ke et al. [15], patient sharing from hospital A to hospital B was calculated by$$ {P}_{A->B}\kern0.5em =\kern0.5em {m}_{A->B}/{N}_B $$
                        , where N
                           i
                   represents the number of admissions in hospital i per year and m
                           i->j
                   is the number of patients transferred from hospital i to hospital j per year. We calculated the number of patients transferred from hospital i to hospital j by summing the numbers of direct and indirect patient transfers. Patient sharing between any two hospitals A and B was calculated by the taking the average between two directions:$$ {M}_{AB}\kern0.5em =\kern0.5em \frac{P_{A\to B}\kern0.5em +\kern0.5em {P}_{B\to A}}{2}. $$
                        , We used three statistics to characterize genetic differentiation between hospitals: average pairwise difference (Ï) between isolates from different hospitals, F
                           ST
                  , and the proportion of nearly identical isolates (I). F
                           ST
                   is based on the variance of allele frequencies between populations [33] and was calculated using the R package Hierfstat [34]. The sample sizes for each hospital range from 1 to 68. Hospitals with sample sizes smaller than 10 were excluded in the analysis of F
                           ST
                  ., The proportion of nearly identical isolates between hospitals (I) is determined by the proportion of isolate pairs with smaller than 0.15 % differences among all the SNPs (equivalent to fewer than 37 SNP differences) between hospitals. This threshold is similar to the 40-SNP threshold used to discount direct transmission in previous studies [16, 35, 36]. Given that the mutation rate is 1.22âÃâ10-6 per site per year for USA300 [37] and the size of core genome is 2.5 Mb, the divergence per year is about three SNPs. Thirty-seven SNPs divergence between two genomes therefore corresponds to approximately 6.16 (=37/2/3) years on two lines of descent from the most recent common ancestor, indicating that the maximum divergence time for isolates we are counting as ânearly identicalâ is about 6 years for the threshold of 37 SNPs and about 4 years for the lower threshold of 25 SNPs considered in sensitivity analyses. These divergence times are upper bounds given that (1) we consider SNP distances up to the threshold as ânearly identicalâ and (2) short-term mutation accumulation of bacteria occurs faster than long-term evolutionary rates, due to the survival of weakly deleterious mutations over short but not long time scales [38]., Within-hospital genetic diversity was calculated by averaging the proportion of SNP differences between all pairs of isolates from the same hospital and singleton SNPs were excluded to minimize the effect of potential sequencing error and sample size., To assess statistical significance of observed correlations, test statistics were recalculated for 10,000 random permutations of the data, in each of which the hospital identifier list was permuted relative to the list of isolates., Coalescent simulation was performed using program ms [39]. We assume no recombination, constant population size, an infinite-sites model (all polymorphic sites are biallelic) and no within-host evolution. We used the âsteady-stateâ number of patients (N
                           *) as population size in each hospital. N
                           * was calculated by the number of admissions in each hospital in 1 year times the average length of stay divided by 365 days. In addition, we assumed that there was a subpopulation with population size N
                           *â=â5000, representing the community, and its sample size was 0. The sample sizes used in coalescent simulations were the same as the sample sizes in the data. We assumed that the mutation rate is eight per genome per year [40] and that the generation time is equal to the average of length of stayâ=â9 days., We simulated four scenarios: (1) high patient sharing and high community contribution; (2) high patient sharing and low community contribution; (3) low patient sharing and high community contribution; and (4) low patient sharing and low community contribution. For high patient sharing (1 and 2), empirical patient sharing from Orange County was used for migration rates between subpopulations in the coalescent model; for low patient sharing (3 and 4), migration rate was equal to empirical patient sharing from Orange County divided by 100. The number of replicates for each model was 100. The proportion of patients in each hospital that are from the community (C
                           from
                  ), and the proportion of infections in the community that are from each hospital (C
                           to
                  ) are listed in Table 1.Table 1

                    , In addition to infinite-sites model, we also performed coalescent simulations for a single microsatellite marker using the infinite-allele model and a stepwise mutation model [41] in order to compare a single site-multiple alleles microsatellite marker with multiple site-biallelic SNPs. The mutation rate of microsatellites is known to be higher than that of point mutations [42], and therefore we used 104- and 106-times the per-site point mutation rate as the mutation rate for microsatellite model., A total of 986 MRSA isolates were sequenced from 30 hospitals in Orange County in 2008 to 2010, across which 24,660 polymorphic sites were identified in the core genome., The average pairwise genetic distance between samples from the same hospitals was significantly smaller than that between samples from different hospitals (0.353 % vs. 0.357 % of all SNP positions, or 87 and 88 SNP differences; permutation test (nâ=â10,000), P valueâ=â0.0045; Additional file 1: Figure S1A), though the difference between them was small. SNP differences in this range indicate that the isolates are about 15 years (=87/2/3 and 88/2/3) divergence between each other. Among all the isolate pairs with no SNP differences, 66 % (31 out of 47) of them were from the same hospital. Among these 31 pairs from the same hospital, 17 pairs of isolates involve hospital-onset isolates (at least one was isolated after day 2 of the hospital stay), suggesting transmission, and 10 out of 17 pairs of isolates were collected in the same month (Additional file 1: Figure S2). Although the nearest neighbors of some isolates in the phylogeny are from the same hospital, the phylogeny of all hospital-onset isolates shows no visual evidence of clustering between isolates from the same hospitals (Additional file 1: Figure S3). Together, the distributions of within and between hospital pairwise distance (Additional file 11 Figure S1A) and the phylogeny (Additional file 1: Figure S3) suggest that gene flow between hospitals facilitated by patient sharing between hospitals diluted the genetic structure to the point that pairwise genetic diversity cannot be used to distinguish isolates from the same or different hospitals., We tested the factors that were associated with within-hospital genetic diversity. Because estimates of the within-hospital genetic diversity are sensitive to the sample size (Pearsonâs correlation test between within-hospital genetic diversity and sample size, râ=â0.376, P valueâ=â0.045), we calculated the partial correlation between within-hospital genetic diversity and other factors when controlling for the sample size and excluded four hospitals with a sample size of less than five from analysis., The number of admissions per year (ranging from 1,068 to 30,930) and the proportion of community-onset isolates (ranging from 56 % to 100 %) were not significantly correlated with within-hospital genetic diversity (P valuesâ=â0.41 and 0.10). The number of hospitals that a hospital receives patients from (indegree) and the proportion of patients from other hospitals were both positively correlated with within-hospital genetic diversity (Pearson partial correlation coefficientsâ=â0.587 and 0.563, P valuesâ=â0.00051 and 0.0011, respectively) (Additional file 1: Figure S4). The indegree and the proportion of patients from other hospitals were significantly positively correlated with each other (Pearsonâs correlation râ=â0.562, P valueâ=â0.0028)., We used three methods to characterize genetic differentiation between hospitals: average pairwise difference (Ï) between isolates from different hospitals, the fixation index F
                           ST
                  , and the proportion of nearly identical isolates (I), which is defined as the proportion of isolate pairs with smaller than 0.15 % differences (equivalent to smaller than 37 SNPs) among all the SNPs between a pair of hospitals. A similar threshold, 40 SNPs, was used to discount direct transmission between individual patients in previous studies [16, 35, 36]., First, we compared genetic differentiation between hospitals with and without patient sharing. The proportion of nearly identical isolates between hospitals with patient sharing was significantly larger than that between hospitals without patient sharing (medianâ=â0.0055 vs. 0; permutation test (nâ=â10,000), P valueâ=â0.008, Additional file 1: Figure S5). F
                           ST
                   and the average pairwise difference Ï between hospitals with patient sharing were not significantly smaller than those without patient sharing (permutation test (nâ=â10,000), P valuesâ=â0.136 (F
                           ST
                  ) and 0.900 (Ï))., Next we estimated the association between genetic differentiation and the level of patient sharing (M). The proportion of nearly identical isolates between hospitals was significantly positively correlated with the level of patient sharing (Pearsonâs correlation r between log(I) and log(M)â=â0.185, Mantel test P valueâ=â0.038; Fig. 1). The results were relatively insensitive to the choice of SNP difference cutoff values used to define nearly identical isolates (Additional file 1: Figure S6). The correlation between F
                           ST
                   and the level of patient sharing was weaker and not statistically significant (Pearsonâs correlation r of log(M) and log(F
                           ST
                  )â=â-0.112, Mantel test P valueâ=â0.11), and the same applied to the correlation between the average pairwise difference and the level of patient sharing (Pearsonâs correlation r of log(M) and Ïâ=â0.085, Mantel test P valueâ=â0.20).
                      Fig. 1
                        The proportion of nearly identical isolates increases with the level of patient sharing (Pearsonâs correlation r between log(M) and log(I)â=â0.185, Mantel test P valueâ=â0.038; I and M are the proportion of nearly identical isolates and the level of patient sharing, respectively)
                      , Isolate pairs with smaller SNP differences were more likely to come from the same hospitals or hospitals with a higher level of patient sharing (Fig. 2), suggesting that patient sharing transmits strains between hospitals. We hypothesized that the lack of significant association between patient sharing and F
                           ST
                   or Ï is because these measures are less powerful than the proportion of nearly identical isolates for detecting population structure when gene flow between populations is high, as in the case here, since the latter is particularly sensitive to detecting recent transmission events. For example, in Wrightâs island model with the same subpopulation sizes and migration rates among them [43], F
                           ST
                   at equilibrium is approximately 1/(1â+â2âNm), where N is the size of each subpopulation and m is the migration rate between subpopulations [44]. It is therefore expected that when Nm is large, F
                           ST
                   is not very sensitive to each unit change in Nm. When patient sharing is high, exchange of alleles between hospitals is expected to be frequent, and allele frequencies in different hospitals tend to be similar. In this case, the impact of genetic drift and sampling error on allele frequencies can be similar to that of patient sharing. Because Ï and F
                           ST
                   are based on allele frequencies, their powers to detect the effect of patient sharing is lower.
                      Fig. 2
                        Isolate pairs with smaller SNP differences were more likely to come from the same hospital or hospitals with higher level of patient sharing. a Isolate pairs with smaller SNP differences were more likely to come from the same hospital (red line) than 100 permutations of random assignment of hospitals (gray lines). b In order to obtain the effect of different levels patient sharing, we calculated normalized proportion of pairs, which is the quantity (N
                                       ki
                          /N
                                       i
                          )/(N
                                       k
                          /N), where N is the total number of pairs of isolates, N
                                       k
                           is the number of pairs of isolates from hospitals with a particular amount of patient sharing k, N
                                       i
                           is the number of pairs of samples with less than i SNP differences, and N
                                       ki
                           is the number of pairs of samples coming from hospitals with a particular amount of patient sharing k differing by less than i SNPs. Samples collected from the hospitals with higher level of patient sharing were more likely to have smaller SNP difference. Even a very low level of patient sharing (0.1-0.2 %) shows higher normalized proportion of pairs with smaller SNP differences than no patient sharing
                      , We performed coalescent simulations to test our hypothesis. We simulated four scenarios: (1) high patient sharing (corresponding to migration between populations in the coalescent model) and high community contribution (corresponding to migration from an unsampled population with large population size); (2) high patient sharing and low community contribution; (3) low patient sharing and high community contribution; and (4) low patient sharing and low community contribution. The parameter values are described in Methods and shown in Table 1. The results show that when patient sharing between hospitals is high, either due to high patient transfer between hospitals (Model 2) or high level of community-onset infections in hospitals (Model 3) or both (Model 1), using the proportion of nearly identical isolates is more powerful than F
                           ST
                   because it is sensitive to recent transmission events if proper SNP difference cutoff values are used (Fig. 3). If patient sharing is low (Model 4), the SNP difference between isolates from different hospitals is high and the proportion of nearly identical isolates is often 0 and less useful when the threshold is small (Fig. 3). The average pairwise difference is generally less powerful because it highly depends on allele frequency. For example, if allele frequencies in two hospitals are both 0.5, it suggests that genetic differentiation is low, but the average pairwise difference between hospitals in this case appears to be high (Ï =0.5). We also showed that the stochastic variation of F
                           ST
                   and Ï between simulation runs is higher than that of the proportion of nearly identical isolates (Additional file 1: Figure S7).

                                       ST
                           if the threshold for nearly identical isolates is chosen properly. F

                           is more sensitive to changes in patient sharing if patient sharing is high (Model 4). Ï is less powerful in all four models here
                      , Because we were extending an analysis to genomic data that had previously been performed with spa typing, we sought to understand how allele-frequency based analyses with single-locus markers compared to genome-wide, SNP-based analyses. The mutational process of the spa gene is complex, including deletion, duplication, and point mutations. For simplicity and generality, we compared the power of F
                           ST
                   derived from a single-locus multiple-alleles microsatellite marker with that of multiple-locus biallelic SNPs to detect the effect of patient sharing. We ran computer simulations using two models for the microsatellite locus: an infinite alleles model and a stepwise mutation model. In the infinite alleles model, each mutation leads to a new allele; in stepwise mutation model, each mutation can either increase or decrease the number of sequence repeats by 1. We assumed the mutation rate in the microsatellite model is 104 or 106-fold higher than the per-site mutation rate in the multiple-locus SNP model., When patient sharing is high and the contribution of strains from community-onset infections is relatively low (Model 2), F
                           ST
                   calculated from microsatellite markers is more sensitive than F
                           ST
                   calculated from multiple-locus biallelic SNPs (Additional file 1: Figure S8). When the community contribution is high (Models 1 and 3) the proportion of significant associations using F
                           ST
                   calculated from microsatellite markers and using F
                           ST
                   calculated from multiple-locus biallelic SNPs are similar and both small. When patient sharing and community contribution are both low (Model 4), multiple-locus biallelic SNPs perform better than microsatellite markers. The stochastic variation in F

                   of microsatellite markers is smaller than that of SNPs, and is smaller when mutation rate is higher (Additional file 1: Figure S7 and S9)., If the hospitals are closer to each other, they are more likely to have overlapping community catchment areas. We hence hypothesized that community-onset infections in hospitals closer to each other would be similar genetically. The proportion of nearly identical isolates decreases with geographic distance (D) (Pearsonâs correlation r between log(I) and Dâ=â-0.193, Mantel test P valueâ=â0.086) and F
                           ST
                   increases with geographic distance (Pearsonâs correlation r between F
                           ST
                   and Dâ=â0.187, Mantel test P valueâ=â0.076), though only borderline significant, suggesting that genetic differentiation increases with geographic distance. However, it is difficult to distinguish the effects of geographic distance and patient sharing on genetic differentiation, because geographic distance and patient sharing were highly correlated with each other (Pearsonâs correlation râ=â-0.454, Mantel test P valueâ=â0.0002). Ideally, we could separate hospital-onset (HO) and community-onset (CO) samples into two groups and test whether the association between genetic differentiation and geographic distance is higher in the CO group and the association between genetic differentiation and patient sharing is stronger in the HO group, but our sample sizes are not sufficient for performing these tests., Moreover, we tested the effect of average CO proportions on genetic differentiation between hospitals. The correlation between the average CO proportion and F
                           ST
                   (Pearsonâs correlation râ=â-0.143, Mantel test P valueâ=â0.20) and the correlation between the average CO proportion and the log of the proportion of nearly identical isolates (Pearsonâs correlation râ=â0.156, Mantel test P valueâ=â0.21) were not significant. Because the effect of average CO proportions on genetic differentiation may depend on the level of overlapping communities, we calculated the partial correlation between average CO proportions and genetic differentiation given geographic distance between hospitals. The partial correlation of average CO proportion and genetic differentiation were still not significant after controlling for geographic distances between hospitals (log(I), Pearsonâs correlation râ=â0.174, Mantel test P valueâ=â0.19; F
                           ST
                  , Pearsonâs correlation râ=â-0.160, Mantel test P valueâ=â0.16). The lack of statistically significant impact of CO proportion here could be due to the limited variation in CO proportion across hospitals (Additional file 1: Table S1)., In this study, we used genome sequencing data of 986 MRSA regional isolates to study MRSA transmission within and between hospitals and between hospitals and their surrounding community. We confirmed the impact of patient sharing on population structure [15] by showing a positive correlation between the proportion of nearly identical isolates between hospitals and the level of patient sharing. We found that many sample pairs without any SNP difference were from unique patients from the same hospital and their time of sample collection was very close, supporting the presence of within-hospital transmission, consistent with earlier findings that patient-to-patient transmission occurs, even if attentive infection prevention strategies are used [36]., Although we detected a significant association between the proportion of nearly identical isolates and patient sharing, the association between F
                           ST
                   and patient sharing was not significant. We propose that these different results might be due to a lack of power of F
                           ST
                   when patient sharing and the contribution of community-onset infections are high, and we confirmed our hypothesis by performing coalescent simulations using parameters informed by empirical data. The association between patient sharing and F
                           ST
                   calculated from spa types in Ke et al. [15] was likely attributed to the rare and more divergent isolates with spa types that were excluded from the present study. Although the variation in spa types is usually too low for detailed tracking of spatial spread in short-term local settings, if there is enough variation, it can potentially be powerful because when the rare or more divergent isolates were shared between hospitals, it was very likely due to patient sharing., Only a certain amount of divergence can occur before a spa change causes the sample to be discarded from the t008-lineage dataset. If within-hospital diversity reaches the maximum expected saturation point for within-spa type diversity, F
                           ST
                   is not a suitable measure for genetic differentiation between hospitals. Engelthaler et al. showed that within-spa type diversity can be in the order of thousands of SNPs [45], which is much greater than the maximum SNP difference (269 bp) in our dataset. This suggests that it is unlikely that the saturation of within-t008 diversity lowered the power of F
                           ST
                   in our study., It has been suggested that the cloud of diversity is a major issue in identifying person-to-person transmission links [46, 47]. We sequenced a single isolate from each patient and do not have the information of within-host genetic diversity. However, we are concerned about hospital-level rather than patient-level dynamics in this study, and because the importance of patient-to-patient transmission effects diminishes considerably at the group level [47], there is less concern about within-host diversity here. To directly explore the impact of within-host diversity, multiple within-host pathogen genomic sequences from a range of scenarios, together with comprehensive epidemiological data, would be required., 
                           S. aureus has been shown to be primarily clonal with relatively low levels of recombination [37, 48â50]. We used Gubbins [51] to detect recombination in our dataset, and identified six regions of recombination, which in average account for 0.00064 % of genome and 5.93 % of SNPs. We excluded these regions and repeated our within-hospital analysis of within-hospital genetic diversity and the association between the proportion of nearly identical isolates, F
                           ST
                   and Ï with patient sharing, and the results are consistent with the results before removing recombination (Additional file 1: Table S3). Genealogy-based methods generally perform better than F
                           ST
                   if there is no recombination [52], however, genealogy-based parametric methods, such as BEAST [53] or MIGRATE-N [54, 55], cannot be used for estimating migration rate between hospitals because the number of parameters is too high (870 if using non-symmetric migration rates and 435 if using symmetric migration rates). Moreover, many pairs of sister strains on the tips of the phylogeny comes from different hospitals (Additional file 1: Figure S3), suggesting that many branches would have multiple migration events. Therefore, even if parametric methods were used to reduce the number of separate migration rates to estimate, the inference of rates is less reliable and many combinations of estimates might fit the data equally well., The phylogenetic tree we constructed shows relatively long external branches compared with internal branches (Additional file 1: Figure S3). A similar shape of phylogeny has also been seen in other studies of S. aureus in the United States [37, 56]. There are five possible explanations for star-like phylogeny: recombination [57, 58]; sequencing error; population expansion [59]; selective sweep [60]; and long-term colonization. The phylogeny after removing recombination regions detected by Gubbins is still star-like (Additional file 1: Figure S10), suggesting that recombination is unlikely to be the reason. We could not entirely rule out the possibility of sequencing error, but because we were still able to find several pairs of identical isolates, we think it does not play a major role in our dataset. Given that USA300 is a recently emerging clone [25], it is possible that population expansion and/or a selective sweep leads to the longer external branches. To test this hypothesis and to explore possible mechanisms resulting in such dynamics, further research would be required. Finally, long-term persistence in the host can lead to long external branches in the phylogeny [61], and because MRSA colonization sometimes persist for a long time [62], intra-host evolution can potentially explain part of the pattern seen here., Our simulation results also indicate that, when F
                           ST
                   is used, genomic SNP data are not always more powerful than microsatellite markers (though the proportion of nearly identical isolates identified by genome-wide SNP data is more powerful than microsatellite F
                           ST
                   in our four models). When there is no recombination, there is one single evolutionary tree for all loci, and F
                           ST
                   calculated from genome-wide SNP does not benefit from taking the average of multiple partially independent trees as it would in organisms with frequent recombination. Microsatellite markers are more sensitive to recent events than to events in the distant past because each new mutation can potentially lead to a new allele and the number of mutations (or the divergence time) between alleles is not trackable. Also, in the long term, a series of mutations can lead to convergence that would be misinterpreted as identity by descent [24, 63]. When patient sharing is high and community contribution is relatively low, microsatellite markers perform better than SNPs. In contrast, when patient sharing is low, the power of microsatellite markers is lower. Regions such as microsatellites that mutate rapidly are difficult to assay using next-generation sequencing methods based on short reads, but technological advances have the potential to greatly increase the read length [64], and we can expect that this will make these regions and their variation accessible to genomic analyses., With advances in sequencing technologies, very large samples of pathogen genomes are becoming available and can be used for studying disease transmission. Pathogen samples can be collected across different geographic scales, such as on the country, city, or hospital levels. Here we showed that for samples from different hospitals in the same county, the proportion of nearly identical isolates was more useful for detecting the effect of patient sharing than the classical statistic F
                        ST
                 when using genomic data, and that F

                Background
                Inter-tissue molecular interactions are critical to the function and behavior of biological systems in multicellular organisms, but systematic studies of interactions between tissues are lacking. Also, existing studies of inter-tissue interactions are based on direct gene expression correlations, which canât distinguish correlations due to common genetic architectures versus biochemical or molecular signal exchange between tissues.
              
                Methods
                We developed a novel strategy to study inter-tissue interaction by removing effects of genetic regulation of gene expression (genetic decorrelation). We applied our method to the comprehensive atlas of gene expression across nine human tissues in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to generate novel genetically decorrelated inter-tissue networks. From this we derived modules of genes important in inter-tissue interactions that are likely driven by biological signal exchange instead of their common genetic basis. Importantly we highlighted communication between tissues and elucidated gene activities in one tissue inducing gene expression changes in others.
              
                Results
                We reveal global unidirectional inter-tissue coordination of specific biological pathways such as protein synthesis. Using our data, we highlighted a clinically relevant example whereby heart expression of DPP4 was coordinated with a gene expression signature characteristic for whole blood proliferation, potentially impacting peripheral stem cell mobilization. We also showed that expression of the poorly characterized FOCAD in heart correlated with protein biosynthetic processes in the lung.
              
                Conclusions
                In summary, this is the first resource of human multi-tissue networks enabling the investigation of molecular inter-tissue interactions. With the networks in hand, we may systematically design combination therapies that simultaneously target multiple tissues or pinpoint potential side effects of a drug in other tissues.

With the networks in hand, we may systematically design combination therapies that simultaneously target multiple tissues or pinpoint potential side effects of a drug in other tissues., Tissues in multicellular organisms do not operate in isolation, but interact with other tissues and organ systems. Examples include the control of adrenal glucocorticoid secretion by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the regulation of glucose homeostasis by the endocrine pancreas. Although abundant large-scale data on proteinâprotein interactions and geneâgene interactions [1â3] in single tissues have been reported, large scale unbiased interactions across tissues are currently less well characterized. An unbiased picture of interactions between tissues in humans will provide essential insights into human biology in health and disease and further assist in the development of treatments for complex disease. For example, therapeutically targeting a gene in one tissue may cause side effects or beneficial effects in distant tissues. Therefore, a systematic method of uncovering tissueâtissue interactions in an unbiased way is urgently needed., Previously we reported an inter-tissue view of obesity in mice with respect to molecular states that are associated with physiological states using gene expression in adipose, liver and hypothalamus from an F2 progeny [4]. Currently, the overall picture of tissueâtissue interactions at the transcriptional level in healthy humans remains unknown. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project [5] aims to create a comprehensive public atlas of gene expression and its regulation across multiple human tissues. This project aims to release genotype and transcriptome data generated by RNA-Seq in more than 30 tissues of approximately 900 post-mortem donors [6]. In its pilot phase, expression data for nine tissues from 185 subjects are available. In this dataset, multiple tissues have been profiled within each subject, enabling us to perform an inter-tissue interaction analysis (Additional file 1). To our knowledge this is the first comprehensive resource of multi-tissue human expression data enabling the investigation of molecular tissueâtissue interactions in healthy people., In this study, we aim to distinguish between inter-tissue interactions caused by different factors (Fig. 1). Expression levels of two genes in two tissues, e.g., y
                        i,h
                         for gene i in the heart, and y
                        j,a
                         for gene j in adipose tissue, are correlated because they are regulated independently by the same genetic locus (Fig. 1a), or they respond independently to the same environmental cues (Fig. 1b), or gene i in the heart signals to the adipose and regulates expression of gene j (Fig. 1c). Transcriptional regulation of gene expression in different tissues by common genetic or environmental perturbations has been well studied [7]. A comparison of co-expression modules of genes within individual tissues has revealed conservation of biological pathways responding to common genetic or environmental signals [8â10]. However, signaling between tissues via biological signals that regulate transcription has not been extensively studied. Here we developed a novel strategy for generating a global view of tissueâtissue interactions at the transcriptional level (Fig. 2). To derive modules of genes important in inter-tissue interactions that are driven by biological signal exchanges instead of their common genetic basis, we performed a genetic-decorrelated tissueâtissue coexpression (gdTTC) network analysis for all pairs of tissues. Genetic decorrelation is a method to remove all genetic contribution from y
                        i,a
                         by regression y
                        i,a
                        ââ¼âSNP
                        S
                â+ây
                        i,a
                        *. The resulting y
                        i,a
                        * is expected to be independent from genetic regulation. Following the genetic decorrelation of all gene expression data, we performed standard bipartite clustering in order to identify clusters of genes and derived biological insight related to the inter-tissue correlations. To dissect sub-clusters within a cluster, we developed a selection algorithm for identifying asymmetric inter-tissue interactions, called gene-to-module detection, to find sub-clusters regulated by a few genes noted as key regulators and their biological function.

                      Schema depicting the novel strategy for generating genetically decorrelated inter-tissue networks and deriving modules of genes important in inter-tissue interactions that are driven by biological signal exchanges instead of their common genetic basis. The black line between gene Kâ and Jâ denotes the undesired correlation due to shared genetic basis, which will be removed after decorrelation. Red lines denote genuine correlations due to non-genetic biological interactions. A gene module detection strategy is used to claim a set of genes, namely module M, in tissue B is correlated with a gene, namely Kâ in tissue A. We hypothesize that asymmetric inter-tissue correlations, whereby a gene in one tissue is asymmetrically correlated to a group of genes in a second tissue, may indicate interesting unidirectional interactions between tissues. If gene Kâ is correlated with module M while the average number of correlations between members in M and other genes in tissue A is much lower than the links between Kâ and M, we report this asymmetric association. Biological function associated with these unidirectional interactions is determined by gene ontology enrichment analysis, which provides insight into systemic pathway coordination
                    , Here we provide an unbiased global view of the asymmetric molecular interactions between pairs of nine human tissues, which reflect biological processes that are being communicated and coordinated amongst tissues rather than common responses to genetic variations. We show that some pathways, such as the âestablishment of protein localization to organelleâ and âtranslational initiationâ, are the most prevalent pathways observed amongst all asymmetric inter-tissue coexpression networks identified. On the other extreme is the observation that a wide variety of pathways are found enriched only in asymmetric inter-tissue coexpression networks between a single pair of tissues. Our tissueâtissue coexpression network analysis revealed novel asymmetric inter-tissue interactions of which we highlight two. As a clinically relevant example, we show an asymmetric inter-tissue sub-network whereby heart DPP4 is coexpressed with a module of cell cycle-related genes in whole blood, suggesting DPP4 expression in the heart coordinates whole blood proliferation, thereby potentially regulating stem cell trafficking and mobilization to peripheral tissues. As a second example, we show that expression of the poorly characterized FOCAD in the heart correlates with protein biosynthetic processes in the lung., Tissue samples collected in the GTEx pilot study [5] were from 237 post-mortem donors. A full description can be found in the Supplementary Materials of the GTEx pilot study [5]. Briefly, sampled tissues were preserved in PAXgeneÂ® tissue kits (PreAnalytiXÂ®). Samples were fixed for a minimum of 2â4 hours, and then placed in the stabilizer buffer for shipping to the GTEx Comprehensive Biospecimen Resource (CBR). The mean sample ischemic time was around 420 minutes [5]. Supporting quality documents and workflows for the project are available at http://âbiospecimens.âcancer.âgov/âresources/âsops/âdefault.âasp., Note that tissues collected in the GTEx study are postmortem. MelÃ© et al. [11] show that gene expression profiles in the GTEx study are similar to the profiles of corresponding tissues from living donors, and tissue profile classifiers based on profiles in the GTEx study can accurately classify expression profiles of tissues from living donors in multiple independent studies. MelÃ© et al. [11] also show that sample ischemic time in the GTEx study has a small impact on gene expression but a larger impact on splicing., Total RNA was isolated from PAXgeneÂ® tubes using proper Qiagen kits following the manufacture's specification. Detailed experimental procedures for blood, PAXGene-preserved, and frozen tissue samples can be found in the Supplementary Materials of the GTEx pilot study [5]. All samples sequenced had a RNA integrity number (RIN) value of 6.0 or higher and at least 1 Î¼g of total RNA., RNA sequencing was performed using a standard non-strand specific protocol with poly-A selection of mRNA. Non-strand-specific RNA sequencing was performed at the Broad Institute using a large-scale, automated variant of the Illumina Tru Seqâ¢ RNA Sample Preparation protocol (Illumina: TruSeq Protocol Info). Detailed experimental procedures can be found in the Supplementary Materials of the GTEx pilot study [5]., RNA-seq data were aligned with TopHat version v1.4.1 to the UCSC human genome release version hg19 (Genome Reference Consortium GRCh37). Gencode version 12 was used as a transcriptome model for the alignment as well as all gene and isoform quantifications. Unaligned reads were merged back in to create a final bam. Gencode v12 annotates a total of 53,934 genes, including 20,110 protein coding genes, 11,790 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and 12,869 pseudogenes. Expression levels were produced at the gene level in RPKM units using RNA-SeQC. Samples with fewer than 10 million mapped reads were removed., All primary sequence and clinical data files, and any other protected data, are deposited in and available from dbGaP (http://âwww.âncbi.ânlm.ânih.âgov/âgap) (phs000424)., The RNAseq data used for the analyses described in this manuscript were obtained from dbGaP (accession number phs000424.v2.p1) in Feb 2014. It is common practice to adjust known and hidden confounding factors in gene expression data before further analysis [12]. We used PEER factors [13] to represent hidden confounding factors. While removing too many PEER factors increases the risk of filtering out genuine biological signals, adjusting too few PEER factors will obscure interesting discoveries with experimental covariates. To address this problem, we developed a systematic method to quantify the reasonable numbers of PEER factors to be adjusted in each tissue with respect to the optimal gene ontology (GO) enrichment (Notes and Figure S1 in Additional file 2). Many genes had low expression levels and low variances due to zero-valued expression levels in many subjects. As these genes may introduce artificially high correlations between them we removed genes in a tissue expression data set if their standard deviations were smaller than 20 % of the difference between their maximal and minimal expression levels., Using the standard mixed model notations, a gene expression level (e.g., gene i) in a given tissue (e.g., tissue A) can be modeled as Yi,Aâ=âÎ²0â+âugâ+âÎµ, where ug is the random term representing the contribution from a large number of loci of small effects and Îµ is the residual representing other contributions. It is assumed that the total variance was normalized to be one, and both terms follow multivariate normal distribution. More specifically, we assume that Îµâ~âN(0, (1âââhi,A)I), and ugâ~âN(0, hi,AKg), where I is the identity matrix and K

                            is the genotype coded as 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to homozygote, heterozygote, and the other homozygote. Here \( {h}_{i,A}=\frac{Var\left({\mu}_g\right)}{Var\left({\mu}_g\right)+Var\left(\varepsilon \right)} \) is the variance component of expression level of gene i in tissue A that can be explained by genotype, a parameter referred to as âpseudo-heritabilityâ in mixed model literals. We used FaST-LMM method to estimate h

                  , and S is the diagnose matrix formed by eigenvalues of K
                           g
                  . Applying this matrix on the expression data yields transformed expression data for which the genetic contributions are decorrelated. More precisely, we calculate the transformed data by applying transformation Yi,A*â=âDYi,A. Similarly, we generated Y*
                           j,B
                   following the same procedure., As Y
                           i,A
                            is adjusted for all potential environmental covariants, and Y*
                           i,A
                   and Y*

                   contain no contribution from covariance of genome similarity, the inter-tissue interaction represented as a Spearman correlation Corr(Y*

                           j,B
                  ) is likely driven by biological regulation., Following the standard method, for any given Spearman correlation r with sample size n, we calculated a t-statistic using the formula \( \mathrm{t}=\mathrm{r}\sqrt{\left(\mathrm{n}-2\right)/\left(1-{\mathrm{r}}^2\right)} \). Assuming that it follows a t-distribution with degree of freedom dfâ=ân-2, we obtained the p value of the correlation. A pair of genes is defined as being significantly correlated if and only if their correlations meet the following conditions: (1) the p values of correlations based on genetically decorrelated data are <10â3; (2) as transformation may introduce some artificial correlations, we set the p values of correlations based on the original data <1âÃâ10â3.5. False discovery rates (FDRs) were estimated by permutation tests. We randomly permute the sample labels of gene expression data, then re-calculated transformation matrix D and genetically decorrelated data. After calculating correlations based on original and genetically decorrelated data, we counted the number of pairs of genes that were significantly correlated as defined above. For each tissue pair, we performed a permutation test five times and estimated the average FDR for the tissue pair. FDRs for most tissue pairs (Table S2a in Additional file 3) are <0.004 except that for the lung-skin pair, which is 42 %., A natural way to find clusters in two groups of nodes is to use bipartite clustering [17], an established technique in the field of machine learning. We implemented a standard bipartite clustering algorithm using singular values decomposition [17]. However, when applying GO enrichment analysis for the genes in the partitioned clusters, we found no significant enrichment. A bipartite clustering method aims to find balanced clusters in the two groups of nodes. However, inter-tissue interactions may not be bi-directional, where a large number of genes in tissue A correlate with a group of genes in tissue B, but rather unidirectional, where a small number of genes in tissue A interact with a large number of genes in tissue B. We developed the following procedure to identify unidirectional interactions., Given a tissue pair A and B, we define a set of genes for each gene i
                           A
                   in tissue A, namely \( {M}_{i_A,B} \), representing genes in tissue B that are correlated with the gene i
                           A
                   in tissue A. Then, we define significant asymmetry correlation sets as follows. First, we calculate the total number of genes in tissue A that are correlated with any of the members in M (in tissue B) as \( {\displaystyle \sum_{J_B\in {M}_{i_A,B}}{M}_{J_B,A}} \) and the average number of genes for members in \( {M}_{i_A,B} \) as \( A{M}_{i_A,B}=\frac{{\displaystyle \sum_{J_B\in {M}_{i_A,B}}{M}_{J_B,A}}}{M_{i_A,B}} \). If \( {M}_{i_A,B} \) is less than one-tenth of \( {M}_{i_A,B} \), we define the set \( {M}_{i_A,B} \) as a candidate asymmetry set. Second, we check whether candidate asymmetric inter-tissue correlations \( {M}_{i_A,B} \) are due to potential common regulations in a single tissue. For the same gene i in tissue B, we define \( {M}_{i_A,B} \) as an asymmetric set if \( {M}_{i_A,B} \) is less than one-tenth of the size of \( {M}_{i_A,B} \). The significance of a module of size \( \left|{M}_{i_A,B}\right| \) can be approximately estimated using binomial models. For each pair of tissues, we calculate the average number genes that each gene was correlated with. Then, according to the size of a module, we estimate the p value of observing a module of the same size by chance. The p values for modules of size m in each tissue pair is listed in Table S2b in Additional file 3., We used Bioconductor [18] to carry out the GO biological process (GOBP) enrichment analysis. We applied the hypergeometric test using the annotation database âorg.Hs.eg.dbâ. The p value cutoff used was 0.05 dividing the number of GOBPs tested in the corresponding tissue pairs. Since the GOBPs are hierarchically organized in a tree-like structure, terms at different levels of the tree are not comparable. We counted the number of terms in the path from the root as the âlevelâ of each GO term and used only level 3 GO terms. We also applied the hypergeometric test for enrichment analysis using the disease GWAS candidate gene catalog (http://âwww.âgenome.âgov/âgwastudies/â) and disease signature database. MSigDB (http://âwww.âbroadinstitute.âorg/âgsea/âmsigdb/âindex.âjsp) and multiple Human tissue atlas expression profile datasets were used to generate the heat map of the expression levels of the genes in whole blood that correlated with heart DPP4 expression levels [19, 20]., All gene expression data used in this analysis were preprocessed to correct for common confounders such as batch effects and experimental artifacts by adjusting for factors estimated using the probabilistic estimation of expression residuals (PEER) method [13]. After correcting for the PEER factors and filtering lowly expressed genes, we calculated the Spearman correlation for each gene pair between the nine surveyed tissues. In total, there are 9âÃâ8â2â=â36 tissue pairs, and for each tissue pair we calculated around 20,000âÃâ20,000 correlations between gene pairs. An inter-tissue interaction was defined as a pair of genes whose correlations both before and after genetic decorrelation are significant (see \"Methods\" for details)., The major goal and novelty of this study is to explore biological interactions between tissues, in the absence of the potentially confounding common genetic contributions to different genes [4] due to common regulatory elements or shared expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), which were reported in the GTEx paper [5]. A high correlation between two genes in two different tissues can be due to their shared genetic contribution, which obscures tissueâtissue correlations related to biological communication. In order to dissect out these shared genetic contributions, a straightforward procedure would be to remove common genetic effects by conditioning on shared eQTLs. However, this procedure relies on many parameters, such as the number of eQTLs to include, and therefore may suffer from over-fitting, especially for genes whose expression levels have complicated genetic architectures. In general, for any two individuals, the probability of sharing genetic alleles, regardless of how complicated their genetic architecture is, is proportional to their genomic similarity. Motivated by this observation, we developed a procedure to decorrelate genetic effects using the identity-by-state (IBS) matrix as estimated by the genotypes. We first estimated the pseudo-heritability [21], which is the expression variance component explained by the genome similarities [22, 23]. Then we used the estimated heritability to create a transformation matrix for removing genetic regulation from the expression data so that, in theory, the data, after transformation, contain minimal genetic contributions. This procedure is commonly used in mixed models [16, 24] and is described in detail in the \"Methods\" section., After genetic decorrelation, cross-tissue geneâgene correlations were calculated again following the same procedure described above. We used R and R
                           â to represent correlation matrices before and after genetic decorrelation. To evaluate whether the genetic decorrelation procedure effectively removed the genetic component from the data we applied two different tests. First, we compared the shared eQTLs between cross-tissue correlated gene pairs. Given a pair of tissues, we calculated the average number of shared eQTLs (as described in the GTEx pilot analysis [5]) of all pairs of genes that were significantly correlated. By comparing this indicator before and after decorrelating genetic effects, we observed that the average number of shared eQTLs decreased dramatically after transformation (Fig. 3a). Secondly, we compared the correlation between pairs of identical genes in two tissues before and after genetic decorrelation. The genetic architecture of transcriptional regulators for the same gene in different tissues is similar such that common genetic regulation likely contributes to the correlation of expression of the same gene in different tissues. We observed that this proportion was also significantly reduced after applying the transformation (Fig. 3b). Thus, we conclude that our transformation procedure removed a significant portion of the genetic contribution to the correlation of gene expression between tissues.

                      , In some cases, the mixed model-based transformation can also introduce artifacts such as when the pseudo-heritability of two genes is similar. In these instances, their transformation matrix will be alike and could therefore generate artificial correlations. Also, since the sample size of the shared tissue pairs is low (Additional file 1), the variance of the estimate of pseudo-heritability, which is proportional to the sample size, can be large. In order to filter out potential artificial correlations introduced by genetic decorrelation, we adopted the following conservative rule: two genes from two tissues are defined as inter-tissue correlated if and only if they are significantly correlated with each another before and after the transformation. These inter-tissue correlations are most likely due to biological signals instead of common genetics., Given the correlation matrix R
                           â calculated above, for each pair of tissues we constructed inter-tissue coexpression networks as bipartite graphs. In these graphs, the nodes in two columns are the genes in the two tissues, and an edge between two nodes is added if they are inter-tissue correlated. To assess a global pattern of inter-tissue coexpressed genes we examined the total number of significant geneâgene correlations between each tissue pair, which provided an estimate of the degree of potential biological interactions between tissues (Fig. 4a). Among the top five pairs of tissue were nerve and heart, with nerve in combination with heart, adipose and thyroid, and heart in combination with nerve, thyroid and adipose. Given that the function of nerves within the nervous system is to send signals from one part of the body to another and to receive feedback in order to coordinate motor and sensory responses, it is not surprising to observe a significant number of inter-tissue correlations involving the tibial nerve. Similarly, given the intimate connection between the heart and the circulation, which delivers blood to all parts of the body, observing a significant number of inter-tissue coexpressions is expected. In contrast, the lung was the most prominent in tissue pairs scoring the lowest number of inter-tissue correlations in combination with skin, whole blood and muscle.

                      , Gene clusters derived using a standard bipartite clustering algorithm [17] were not significantly enriched in any GOBP. A standard bipartite clustering aims to find a cluster of genes interacting with another cluster of genes in the second tissue. However, cross-tissue interactions may be unidirectional, e.g., a few genes in one tissue regulate many genes in another tissue. Thus, we developed a selection strategy for identifying asymmetric inter-tissue correlation patterns. For each individual gene we assessed whether there was a large cluster of genes in another tissue asymmetrically linked with it, which were referred to as gene-to-module relationships (Fig. 2). The numbers of gene-to-module relationships identified in each pair of tissues are listed in Additional file 4. We then performed GO enrichment analysis on the top 20 most significant gene-to-module relationships to infer which biological pathways are involved in inter-tissue interactions. The complete set of significantly enriched pathways is listed in Additional file 5. It is worth noting that the total number of inter-tissue relationships and the number of biological pathways enriched among genes involved in gene-to-module relationships (Fig. 4a) were not related. The tissue pairs with the largest number of enriched level 3 GOBPs, such as thyroidâskin and thyroidâblood, had small numbers of total cross-tissue correlations (Fig. 4a). Thyroid is the tissue where gene expression is most likely to be regulated by genetic variation [5] so that genetic decorrelation has the largest effect for thyroid expression data. These results indicate that decorrelating genetic effects may facilitate the identification of biological connections between tissues., The GOBPs associated with the top 20 most significant gene-to-module relationships according to the tissue pairs they were identified in are summarized in Fig. 4b (GO terms used in the analysis are listed in Additional file 6). Some pathways associated with unidirectional interactions between tissues were enriched in many tissue pairs while other pathways were only enriched in specific tissue pairs (Fig. 4b). A closer look at the extremes revealed some interesting observations. Most strikingly, four pathways, including establishment of protein localization to organelle, translational initiation, cellular component disassembly and ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis, were identified in almost all tissue pairs, revealing global synchronization of these processes by unidirectional inter-tissue interactions. Since these pathways are related to protein synthesis, our result likely reveals the importance of coordination in growth processes within the human body and that this coordination can be achieved via asymmetric molecular interactions. The joint coordination of protein biology across tissues via asymmetric interactions implies the expression of one gene in one tissue is sufficient to impact clusters of genes related to protein biology in another., Other pathways that were involved in inter-tissue interactions in most tissue pairs included different aspects of the immune responses (complement activation, adaptive immune response, humoral immune response, leukocyte-mediated immunity), metabolism (generation of precursor metabolites and energy) and cell division., While these analyses provide information on the number of inter-tissue correlations and the associated GOBPs, they do not specify the regulators or source nodes (as shown in Fig. 2) of these interactions. We collected source nodes of the top ten most significant gene-to-module relationships in each tissue pair, and characterized them according to gene types (Fig. 5a). There were a total of 617 source nodes, among which 345 (56 %) source nodes were protein coding genes, significantly higher than the 37 % expected (p valueâ=â1.6âÃâ10â21). Even though there are more transcripts mapped to pseudogenes than to lncRNAs, there were more lncRNAs than pseudogenes among source nodes. These results suggest that protein coding genes and lncRNAs play a significant role in inter-tissue communication.

The most biologically diverse interactions are from thyroid to artery. lincRNA long intergenic non-coding RNA
                      , Instead of counting which GOBPs are inter-tissue regulated as shown in Fig. 4, we examined which GOBPs are inter-tissue regulated in a unidirectional way. For each source node we therefore picked only the top significantly enriched GOBP associated with its gene cluster (listed in Additional file 7). We then counted the number of unique GOBPs for each possible tissue pair (Fig. 5b). This revealed that the most biologically diverse interactions are from thyroid to artery. One example of such interactions is the correlation of HEBP2 in thyroid with genes involved in translational elongation in the artery. HEBP2 is a small heme binding protein that potentially regulates necrotic cell death and mitochondrial permeability [25]. HEBP2 is universally expressed in all tissues. However, HEBP2 protein expression is high only in thyroid tissue except for male reproductive tissues (http://âwww.âproteinatlas.âorg/âENSG00000051620-HEBP2/âtissue), suggesting a potential role of HEBP2 in thyroid. Other prominent interactions are from heart to artery, artery to thyroid and nerve to artery. An example of the former interaction is the correlation of SRPX2 in heart to genes associated with the respiratory electron transport chain in artery. SRPX2 encodes a secreted protein containing sushi repeat domains that can mediate angiogenesis [26]. SRPX2 also plays a role in synapse formation and vocalization in mice and mutations in SRPX2 have been identified in disorders of language cortex and cognition [27, 28]., These results suggest that multiple biological processes are systemically coordinated via unidirectional interactions between tissues. In an effort to demonstrate the utility of inter-tissue coexpression in yielding novel biological insights, we highlight in the following section two asymmetric inter-tissue correlation patterns, one related to a prominent anti-diabetic drug target and another to protein synthesis., One example for illustrating inter-tissue communication is between heart and whole blood. DPP4 in the heart was found significantly coexpressed with a set of genes in peripheral whole blood (Additional file 8), which are enriched for genes involved in cell cycle control and DNA replication (Fig. 6a; detailed in Additional file 9). Interestingly, the majority of the correlations between heart DPP4 and the whole blood genes were negative (Additional file 8), suggesting an inverse relationship between heart DPP4 and these processes. To determine the most representative cell populations associated with the DPP4âwhole blood gene set, we compared expression levels of these genes with expression profiles assayed across 126 primary human tissues and cell types in the Gene Enrichment Profiler [29]. Tissue-specific gene expression is summarized by an enrichment score where high enrichment scores mean higher specificity. A heat map of the enrichment scores for the DPP4-correlating whole blood gene set reveals that this set of genes is most highly expressed in many proliferating blood cell types, including embryonic and CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells, preB cells, thymic CD34+ T cells and CD105+ endothelial cells (Fig. 6b; listed in Additional file 10). As correlations between DPP4 in heart and the whole blood gene set are mostly negative (Additional file 8), it suggests that cardiac DPP4 expression is negatively correlated with cell cycle events of multipotent precursor type cells, such as populations of embryonic stem cells, which can differentiate into myeloid progenitor or endothelial progenitor subtypes.

Full enrichment analyses are summarized in Additional file 11. d Literature-based and network-supported associations between DPP4 and SDF-1 with respect to blood and heart. Network-proposed insights are highlighted in blue. The SDF-1/CXCR4 axis has been shown to be critical in tissue repair, including in the heart, as SDF-1 is well known as a key regulator of stem cell migration to sites of tissue injury. A major enzyme mediating the degradation of SDF-1 is DPP4. Suppression of DPP4 enzymatic activities by pharmacological inhibitors preserves SDF-1, which results in enhanced homing of CXCR4+ progenitor cells from bone marrow to infarcted tissues.

                           DPP4, also known as CD26, is a serine protease that cleaves selected N-terminal penultimate amino acids and thereby potentially alters the function of a wide number of substrates [30]. DPP4 exists both as a cell surface protein (mDPP4) with fairly ubiquitous expression as well as a soluble form (sDPP4) in body fluids such as plasma, both having enzymatic capabilities. sDPP4 has been mainly linked to the proteolytic cleavage of DPP4 from the cell membrane [31]. About 90â95 % of serum DPP4 activity is associated with circulating DPP4 levels, but the kinetics and regulation of circulating DPP4 levels remain unclear [32]. Therefore, investigating cross-tissue DPP4 molecular associations could provide valuable insight into DPP4 function in physiology and disease. Thus, DPP4 is an excellent example for investigating inter-tissue coexpression networks, as it provides the biological context to investigate such complex associations., To further investigate the inter-tissue communication being coordinated by cardiac DPP4 expression and the whole blood compartment, we assessed the coexpression network associated with DPP4 within the heart. This within-tissue coexpression network analysis revealed a set of genes that are highly enriched for cytokineâcytokine receptor interactions as well as lipid-related pathways (Fig. 6c; detailed in Additional file 11). Importantly, these genes are also enriched in diseases such as insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and obesity (Fig. 6c). Thus, heart expression of DPP4 appears to be associating its molecular metabolic state with decreased proliferative events in subsets of whole blood cells. We hypothesize that this reflects altered mobilization of stem cells to the heart required for vascular repair in response to metabolic stresses such as diabetes., Extensive literature exists on DPP4, mainly due to DPP4 inhibitors or gliptins, a class of oral hypoglycemics commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes [33]. These compounds lower blood glucose via enhancing circulating levels of the incretin GLP-1. Thus, we looked to validate our inter-tissue network-driven DPP4 hypothesis using existing knowledge. Many studies have demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of DPP4 is associated with a beneficial effect on the incidence of cardiovascular events [30]. Multiple mechanisms have been attributed to this phenomenon, including glucose-lowering, but also other direct cardiovascular effects such as anti-thrombotic as well as cardiac remodeling and inflammation control [34, 35]. This is in part because DPP4 is known to cleave a wide array of bioactive peptides in addition to GLP-1, such as chemokines [36]. Relevant for the validation of our results is the known link between DPP4 activity and molecular signals of hematopoiesis in whole blood, namely that DPP4 is known to cleave and inactivate the stromal cell-derived factor SDF-1 [33, 37]., SDF-1 is a major chemokine regulating stem/progenitor cell trafficking in the bone marrow and tissues [34]. Diabetes and other metabolic disturbances threaten the endothelial layer of the heart, which is critical to maintain cardiac function since endothelial cells have limited proliferative capacity and low proliferation rates trigger atherogenesis. Endothelial restoration depends on the coordinated contribution of local endothelial cells and a subset of bone-marrow progenitor cells (BM-CD34+ or endothelial progenitor cells) that secrete soluble mediators that also stimulate blood vessel growth and re-endothelialization. Diabetes affects the ability of endothelial progenitor cells to migrate to the target tissue because it reduces the activity of the chemotractant molecule SDF-1 through maladaptive DPP4-mediated cleavage, thereby blunting the ability of SDF-1 to trigger CXCR4 or CXCR7 downstream signaling [34, 38]. Our studies suggest that a key âsourceâ of the SDF-1 signal modulating the kinetics of stem/progenitor cells is the expression and activity of DPP4 in the heart. Indeed, body atlas data from BioGPS (http://âbiogps.âorg/â#goto=âgenereport&âid=â1803) showed that the expression level of DPP4 in smooth muscle, cardiac myocytes as well as immune cell types is much higher than that in the whole blood., Although our study cannot determine whether it is sDPP4 and/or mDPP4 responsible for mediating the cross-tissue coordination, overall our data are supported by observations in the literature [39]. Firstly, diabetes induction in a rat model promoted the activation of the membrane-bound form of cardiac DPP4, which resulted in reduced myocardial SDF-1 levels and impaired angiogenesis, a result that could be reversed by genetic and pharmacological ablation of DPP4 [39]. Secondly, in humans, it has been shown that myocardium-derived sDPP4 activity can be assessed in the coronary sinus which also correlates well with DPP4 activity measured in the peripheral vein. Importantly, in patients with diastolic hear failure (DHF), peripheral vein activity of DPP4 was associated with measurements of DPP4 in the coronary sinus as well as with indices representing DHF, such that circulating DPP4 may potentially serve as a biomarker for monitoring DHF [39]. Finally, circulating DPP4 activities in both peripheral and coronary sinus in patients with comorbid diabetes were also increased, thus further supporting the importance of DPP4, of which some proportion is cardiac derived., Interestingly, our data demonstrated a significant correlation (p valueâ=â0.02; Fig. 6c) between DPP4 expression in heart and heart expression of CXCR7, a SDF-1 receptor [40] whose expression on the endothelium has been linked to regulation of systemic levels of SDF-1 [38], suggesting that mDPP4 is likely mediating this cross-tissue communication via SDF-1. Thus, overall, our inter-tissue data-driven network approach could recapitulate the known biology, namely that metabolic disturbances of the heart are negatively associated with progenitor cell populations in the blood via DPP4 expression [33] (solid and dashed arrows in Fig. 6d), thus in part validating this novel methodology. Importantly, our network approach supports that a major contributor to the DPP4 pool is heart, especially under metabolic stress, and that there may be an important role for CXCR7 in co-modulating SDF-1 function (Fig. 6d)., One example of asymmetric inter-tissue correlations related to protein synthesis is observed for cardiac expression of the poorly characterized FOCAD (KIAA1797 or focadhesin) and the gene set it correlated with in the lung. This set of genes in lung coordinated by FOCAD was enriched for GOBPs related to protein synthesis, such as translational termination, translational elongation and SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane., Focadhesin is a ubiquitously expressed gene with highest levels in brain, but appreciable levels in other tissues such as heart. Focadhesin was recently described as a tumor suppressor in glioblastoma, polyposis and colorectal cancer [41â43]. The focadhesin protein localizes to the end of actin filaments, where it colocalizes with vinculin, a major component of focal adhesions [41]. Moreover, focadhesin physically interacts with vinculin [41, 44]. No function for this gene has been established in the heart., Focal adhesions are the sites where cells and extracellular matrix physically interact. Many proteins constitute the focal adhesion, with the integrins being the link between the cytosol and the extracellular matrix. Integrins function as cell surface receptors, and their interaction with the extracellular matrix enables them to transduce signals from the outside to the cell (âoutside-inâ signaling). In the heart focal adhesions play an important role in the response to biomechanical stress, enabling the myocardium to undergo structural changes [45]. In the GTEx dataset, FOCAD expression in the heart correlates with integrin Î±5 (ITGA5, r= 0.44, pâ=â1.34âÃâ10â5) and paxillin (PXN, r= 0.37, pâ=â3.12âÃâ10â4), further signifying its role in focal adhesion. Our data suggest that signaling at the focal adhesion not only has effects within the tissue, but can also affect other tissues, in this case the lung. From a mechanistic point of view, it is known that integrins can also signal to the extracellular matrix (âinside-outâ signaling) [46], but how such a signal may be propagated from the heart to the lung is at present unclear., Our observations are consistent with the close interaction between heart and lung as both organs share the same restricted space in the chest. Moreover, heart and lung are also functionally connected, such as that the lungs are responsible for the exchange of CO2 for O2 in blood, while the heart circulates this blood. This tight connection is illustrated by several pathophysiological conditions whereby one organ can develop a problem that influences the efficiency of the other. For example, in pulmonary arterial hypertension there is an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance directly impacting on the right ventricle [47]. Chronic heart failure is associated with mild to moderate changes in pulmonary function [48]., Other evidence supporting a role for FOCAD in heart and lung comes from several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) since variants in FOCAD have been associated with cardiac as well as pulmonary traits. SNPs in FOCAD have been associated with heart rate in American Indians [49], and heart failure in the STAMPEED study [50]. A SNP in FOCAD also associated with a pulmonary function measure (percentage predicted forced expiratory flow from the 25th to 75th percentile/forced vital capacity for latest exam) in the Framingham Heart GWAS [51]. Together these findings implicate focadhesin in inter-tissue communication from heart to lung., Although our DPP4 and FOCAD examples above have relevancy to disease, as DPP4 is a target of current diabetes therapy and the other gene is a GWAS hit, to generalize the utility of our cross-tissue network analysis on informing on disease association we annotated significant inter-tissue gene modules against disease or drug signatures in MSigDB and the catalogue of genes implicated in various GWAS (results listed in Additional file 7). If an inter-tissue gene module is enriched for a GOBP, it is likely enriched for a signature in MSigDB. We also observed 17 gene module pairs from various tissue pairs that were significantly enriched (at Fisherâs exact test p value <0.05/number disease categories) in genes genetically associated with disease. For example, in one adipose to artery gene module where the source node was ANKRD36B (ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein 36B) we found that the genes it correlates with in the artery were significantly enriched in genes reported to have relevance to Gaucher disease severity in humans. Gaucher disease is associated with a genetic defect in breakdown of complex glycolipids and causes a lysosomal storage disorder. Interestingly, although the function of ANKRD36B is not well defined, it has been identified as a tumor-associated antigen in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [52]. Multiple myeloma risk is significantly increased in Gaucher patients, but CLL has also been reported in patients and perhaps our data shed light on some of the biology associated with enhanced cancer risk [53]. Another significant GWAS candidate gene enrichment was found between the arteryâwhole blood tissue pair, with the source node being CPLX2 (Complexin 2) and the associated GWAS for conduct disorder (interaction). Conduct disorder is a prevalent childhood psychiatric condition including a persistent pattern of rule-breaking and aggressive behavior [54]. Interestingly, CPLX2 is a known modulator of neurotransmitter release and has been shown in humans to be decreased in expression in animal models of depression and in humans suffering from depression. CPLX2 knockout mice also have significant abnormalities in cognitive function and synaptic plasticity [55]. Furthermore, variants of this gene have been found associated with attention deficient hyperactivity disorder [56] and schizophrenia [57] and the module of genes it associated with in blood are enriched for the GO pathway related to transmission of nerve impulses. Although CPLX2 expression is considerably high in the brain, bioGPS does suggest ubiquitous expression and one hypothesis from our dataset that could be tested is whether Clpx2 modulates release of a signal in the blood that in turn impacts on the brain., It is known that sample ischemic time impacts on RNA quality, which in turn affects gene expression profiles. RNA quality is quantified as the RNA integrity number (RIN). The RNAseq data preprocessing process removed confounding factors, including sample ischemic time and RINs represented as PEER factors. To specifically check residual effect of sample ischemic time and RINs on the data (after correcting PEER factors) used in this study, we correlated sample ischemic time and RINs with gene expression profiles, and the correlation coefficient distributions were found to be similar to those of the permuted data (Figure S2 in Additional file 2). More specifically, the correlation coefficients between sample ischemic time and heart DPP4 and FOCAD expression levels are 0.07 and 0.04, with corresponding p values of 0.28 and 0.35, suggesting that the processes discussed above are not due to ischemic time., It is worth noting that an asymmetric inter-tissue correlation suggests but is not equivalent to a causalâreactive relationship between tissues. Even though in the example of heart DPP4 and whole blood expression changes we highlighted substantial evidence supporting a causal role of heart DPP4, we need to be cautious when assuming causalâreactive relationships in general. Second, the inter-tissue relationships are based on a healthy cohort, which are useful for understanding general communication between tissues. However, the inter-tissue relationships for a specific disease may be different. Multi-tissue profiles from a disease cohort are needed to construct inter-tissue relationships under a disease state. Inter-tissue relationship differences between healthy and disease states may shed light on how multiple tissues together contribute to disease pathogenesis. Third, the accuracy of the transformation matrix D used in genetic decorrelation depends on the sample size. A large number of samples are needed to robustly estimate the matrix D and to use our inter-tissue analysis based on genetic decorrelation., We have developed an effective strategy to generate genetically decorrelated inter-tissue networks that have the power to highlight communication between tissues and elucidate genes active in one tissue inducing gene expression changes in another tissue. This analysis revealed global unidirectional inter-tissue coordination of certain biological pathways, such as protein synthesis. We highlighted cardiac FOCAD as one potential key mediator of this process between the heart and lung. Beyond the conserved pathways, we also uncovered a clinically relevant example whereby expression levels of DPP4 in the heart are coordinated with whole blood proliferation, thereby potentially regulating stem cell proliferation, trafficking and mobilization to peripheral tissues, an observation important for regenerative medicine. More broadly, this is the first resource of human multi-tissue networks enabling the investigation of molecular inter-tissue interactions. With the networks in hand, we may systematically design combination therapies that simultaneously target multiple tissues or pinpoint potential side effects of a drug in other tissues.,

Mutations that affect the enhancer activity of these eExons have been associated with human disease. Therefore, eExon mutations should be taken into account in exome and genome sequencing projects, not only because of the ability of these mutations to modify the encoded proteins but also because of their effects on enhancer activity., Exonic enhancers (eExons) are protein-coding exons that have an additional function as enhancers â gene regulatory elements that instruct promoters as to when, where and at what levels they should be active. Enhancers are activated by the binding of transcription factors and cofactors, which subsequently leads to the activation of their target promoters, either through looping interactions between the enhancer and the promoter or via other mechanisms such as tracking or chromatin modifications [1]. eExons have been shown to regulate the gene in which they reside [2, 3] or even (a) neighboring gene(s) [4]., eExons were discovered by carrying out functional gene regulatory assays. In an enhancer assay the potential enhancer sequence â in this case the coding exon â is placed in front of a minimal promoter (a promoter that should only drive expression if it has an enhancer in front of it) followed by a reporter gene, and checked for its ability to turn on the reporter gene. Experiments in which these assays were used showed that eExons were able to drive expression of a reporter gene (see [2] for an example). eExons can also be discovered using comparative genomics [3, 5, 6]. For example, in a comparison of 29 mammalian genomes, human protein-coding sequences were scanned for regions that have low synonymous substitution rates, which could suggest that they have additional functions, such as being enhancers [6]. This analysis showed that over a quarter of all human protein-coding genes contain these synonymous constraint elements. eExons can also be detected using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), DNase I hypersensitive site sequencing (DNase-seq) or other genomic technologies that can identify enhancers in an unbiased manner [4, 7]., Mutations in eExons could lead to human disease by altering their enhancer activity. eExons 15 and 17 of the dynein cytoplasmic 1 intermediate chain 1 (DYNC1I1) gene are examples of eExons that have been associated with human disease (Fig. 1a). These eExons were shown to be functional enhancers in the developing limb using mouse transgenic enhancer assays. They were also shown to interact with the promoters of distal-less homeobox 5 (DLX5) and distal-less homeobox 6 (DLX6) in the developing limb [4]. These promoters reside ~900 kb away from DYNC1I1. DLX5 and DLX6 are important for limb development and have been associated with split hand and foot malformation (SHFM) in humans [4]. Analysis of patients with SHFM found several chromosomal aberrations that overlap DYNC1I1 exons 15 and 17 (Fig. 1a) [4, 8, 9], which suggests that alterations in these exons could lead to the SHFM phenotype.
                    Fig. 1
                      
                                    DYNC1I1 exonic enhancers (eExons) regulate DLX5 and DLX6. a The DYNC1I1-DLX5/6 locus has two known eExons, DYNC1I1 exons 15 and 17 (colored in blue), that are functional limb enhancers and were shown to interact with DLX5 and DLX6 [4]. A 106 kb deletion (red line) that contains these eExons was found in an individual with split hand and foot malformation (SHFM) [10]. b A fictional example of a mutation in an eExon that could be overlooked in exome or genome sequencing studies. The chromatogram shows a synonymous mutation in an eExon that could leave the protein sequence unchanged but could affect a transcription factor binding site (logo plot below) leading to changes in the enhancer function of this eExon. DLX5 Distal-less homeobox 5, DLX6 Distal-less homeobox 6, DYNC1I1 Dynein cytoplasmic 1 intermediate chain 1
                    , Genomic analyses have also shown that eExons can be quite common in the genome, making up an estimated 7 % of the putative enhancers detected using ChIP-seq [4]. Furthermore, ~15 % of human codons are thought to have sites that are bound by transcription factors (termed duons) on the basis of footprinting analyses of DNase-seq data [7]. Despite being common, the consequences of nucleotide changes on the enhancer function of eExons are usually not taken into account in mutation analyses. Massively parallel reporter assays have shown that the essential functional enhancer sequence of eExons is intertwined with the protein-coding sequence, with both nonsynonymous, synonymous and splice junction mutations having similar deleterious effects on enhancer activity [10]. The transcription factor binding sites were found to be the main constrictive force governing the enhancer function of eExons in this assay. Therefore, a mutation in an eExon, even a synonymous mutation or a mutation in a splice junction, could alter the enhancer activity of this regulatory element and have phenotypic consequences independent of alterations to the protein sequence., Numerous exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing and copy number variant (CNV) studies that aim to identify mutations that cause disease or other phenotypic changes have been carried out or are in progress. More than 17 % of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in coding sequences that overlap a potential functional transcription factor binding site are estimated to alter the site itself [7]. In addition, 13.5 % of coding SNVs that have been associated with disease through genome-wide association studies overlap transcription factor binding sites; 12 % of these SNVs are synonymous and 88 % are nonsynonymous mutations [7]. However, computational analyses in exome or genome sequencing studies are primarily focused on detecting protein-modifying mutations in coding exons and do not specifically consider mutations in eExons that could alter enhancer activity. Therefore, several disease-causing mutations could have been overlooked. For example, a coding mutation in the limb-related DYNC1I1 eExons in a patient with SHFM would probably be considered non-deleterious and ignored in an exome or genome sequencing study (also due to DYNC1I1 not having a known role in limb development), unless these sequences were known to function as eExons (Fig. 1b)., We need to be more conscious of eExons and take them into account when analyzing CNVs and short-sequence variants in exome or genome sequencing data. However, this is not an easy task. Enhancers tend to be cell-type-specific and so eExons could be active only in a specific cell type or tissue, which would make their detection complex. Nevertheless, there are numerous genomic datasets (such as ENCODE or the Roadmap Epigenomics datasets) in which enhancers for various cell types or tissues are annotated, and these datasets will keep on growing. A combined database that provides a list of cell-type-specific or tissue-specific eExons would greatly assist researchers and could be integrated in computational protocols or programs that carry out mutation analyses. The use of programs that predict the effect of regulatory variants on coding sequences, or tools that treat sequences in an unbiased manner regarding their location (that is, in which coding and noncoding mutations are treated similarly), could and should be used to identify changes in eExons that adversely affect their regulatory function., Another limitation is that an eExon could regulate a nearby gene and not the gene in which it resides, as is the case for the DYNC1I1 eExons (Fig. 1). Researchers, despite being aware of the presence of eExons, might ignore a variant in a gene that does not have a known function or that does not fit with the phenotype being analyzed. The use of patient gene expression data, such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, could aid in the identification of a regulatory problem and the gene that is differentially regulated as a consequence. In addition, the use of chromosome conformation datasets [obtained through Hi-C or chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET)], when available for the specific cell type or tissue being studied, could assist in assigning target genes to these eExons and these datasets should be taken into account, as should be done when analyzing noncoding enhancers., In summary, we have not been and are not currently paying sufficient attention in genome and exome sequencing projects to the effects of coding mutations on enhancer activity and other functional elements that could reside in exons. Other than enhancer activity that could reside in exons, these functional elements could include splicing enhancers, RNA secondary structures, microRNA target sites and even dual-coding genes. To conclude, eExons need to be kept in mind when carrying out mutation analyses, in particular for unsolved cases., Distal-less homeobox 5, Distal-less homeobox 6, Dynein cytoplasmic 1 intermediate chain 1, Exonic enhancer, Split hand and foot malformation"

                Background
                Genome-wide data are increasingly important in the clinical evaluation of human disease. However, the large number of variants observed in individual patients challenges the efficiency and accuracy of diagnostic review. Recent work has shown that systematic integration of clinical phenotype data with genotype information can improve diagnostic workflows and prioritization of filtered rare variants. We have developed visually interactive, analytically transparent analysis software that leverages existing disease catalogs, such as the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database (OMIM) and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), to integrate patient phenotype and variant data into ranked diagnostic alternatives.
              
                Methods
                Our tool, âOMIM Explorerâ (http://âwww.âomimexplorer.âcom), extends the biomedical application of semantic similarity methods beyond those reported in previous studies. The tool also provides a simple interface for translating free-text clinical notes into HPO terms, enabling clinical providers and geneticists to contribute phenotypes to the diagnostic process. The visual approach uses semantic similarity with multidimensional scaling to collapse high-dimensional phenotype and genotype data from an individual into a graphical format that contextualizes the patient within a low-dimensional disease map. The map proposes a differential diagnosis and algorithmically suggests potential alternatives for phenotype queriesâin essence, generating a computationally assisted differential diagnosis informed by the individualâs personal genome. Visual interactivity allows the user to filter and update variant rankings by interacting with intermediate results. The tool also implements an adaptive approach for disease gene discovery based on patient phenotypes.
              
                Results
                We retrospectively analyzed pilot cohort data from the Baylor Miraca Genetics Laboratory, demonstrating performance of the tool and workflow in the re-analysis of clinical exomes. Our tool assigned to clinically reported variants a median rank of 2, placing causal variants in the top 1 % of filtered candidates across the 47 cohort cases with reported molecular diagnoses of exome variants in OMIM Morbidmap genes. Our tool outperformed Phen-Gen, eXtasy, PhenIX, PHIVE, and hiPHIVE in the prioritization of these clinically reported variants.

These revolutionary advances in data acquisition have made large-scale genotyping an essential tool for genetic diagnostics and the identification of novel deleterious variants potentially contributing to disease. They hold great promise for the future of molecular diagnosis and management of patients with genetic disease [1â6]. Such technologies also provide particular opportunity for the identification of causes of rare and orphan diseases, which until recently have suffered from a lack of computational tools to help bridge clinical genomics and medical phenotyping and to facilitate diagnostics [7â10]. Despite the promise of available data, the scale of variation presents an interpretive challenge: an individual patientâs genome can have hundreds of rare and putatively deleterious candidate causal variants [11]. Although in some instances diagnostic conclusions can be made without extensive interpretation (e.g., aneuploidies or nonsense variants in disease genes), the presence of numerous potentially deleterious variants typically requires substantial curation to identify the candidate deleterious variant(s) that best matches the clinical phenotypes of the patient in question [1â6, 12, 13]. The goal of integrated diagnostic approaches is to bring together variant knowledge with clinically ascertained patient phenotype characteristics to reach the best-informed diagnostic conclusions (Fig. 1a).
                    Fig. 1
                      Integration of phenotype with genotype in clinical diagnostics of genetic disease. a The diagnostic process is informed by both phenotype and genotype data to arrive at diagnostic conclusions. During the clinical evaluation of patients with suspected genetic disease, physicians observe phenotypic features, and these can be represented in controlled vocabularies (e.g., Human Phenotype Ontology, HPO), amenable to subsequent computational analysis. Physicians also request the acquisition of blood or other tissue samples for molecular characterization of the patient via genome-wide analyses, such as next-generation sequencing. Genotypic analysis provides high-resolution information concerning the location, type, and zygosity of variants within the patient genome. Integration of these data identifies possible solutions that simultaneously match both phenotype and genotype of the patient, excluding unlikely diagnostic candidates and improving differential diagnosis. b Our transitive prioritization approach ranks genes and the variants they harbor against patient phenotype as a function of the discrete disease scores with which the genes were previously associated. This avoids potential underweighting and corresponding ranking inaccuracies resulting from the collapsing approach or direct term-to-gene HPO annotations. c We implemented a curatorial and visual transitive closure approach to infer phenotypic prioritization scores for patient genotype variants. These scores are based on clinical indication similarity scores computed for diseases in the catalog that are reportedly caused by variants in genes that contain filtered patient variants. When multiple diseases are cataloged to result from variants in the same gene, we determine the geneâs score by aggregation of the scores of those diseases using an integrative function. Variants then inherit the scores of the genes in which they are located. The manual curatorial exclusion of diseases or genes from consideration for diagnosis transitively propagates to eliminate genes and variants from the differential
                    , Coincident with the rise of genome-wide data for diagnostics has been the development of standards and catalogs for clinical sign-out [14â16]. Much focus has addressed distinguishing clearly deleterious variants from other variants with less clear contribution to disease. Central to these efforts has been the development of compendia for matching observed variation to well-vetted disease information [11, 17]. Some variants cataloged as âdeleteriousâ can also appear in unaffected individuals, and therefore additional tools have become necessary to identify from among the many candidate variants in affected individuals the specific variants or variant combinationsâsuch as variant pairs for recessive diseaseâthat may explain observed phenotypes [18]., Parallel to the development of catalogs and standards for variant analysis has been the development of systematic tools for representing patient information. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), initially constructed in 2008, is a representation of the features of human disease and the hierarchical relationships that exist among them [19]. A key application of this work is The Phenomizer, a software tool for making comparisons of known diseases to patient phenotypes [20]. This tool uses semantic similarity methods to match patient characteristics, as represented in the HPO, to the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) disease catalog, which is also mapped to the ontology. The Phenomizer returns candidates within the differential diagnosis as lists and tables, with scores representing the quality of the match [1â6, 20]., The goal of variant prioritization is to construct an ordered ranking of observed genetic variation. This objective differs from that of a differential diagnosis, the fundamental purpose of the Phenomizer. To bridge the gap between disease rankings and gene or variant rankings, extensions of this initial approach have been developed and applied to genome-wide diagnostic data. Two such tools are PhenIX [11, 18, 21] and Phenomantics [21], which directly leverage the Phenomizerâs semantic similarity calculation to consider genome-wide genotypic data. Both PhenIX and Phenomantics match query phenotypes to genes by collapsing phenotypes across the diseases to which a geneâs variants have been associated. This approach therefore effectively considers hybrid diseases for use in semantic similarity calculations. Such collapsing may be problematic because it can result in both overestimation and underestimation of semantic similarity matches of candidate genes to patient characteristics (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, these disease diagnostic intermediates are embedded within the computational scheme and hidden from the user, preventing user-informed exclusion of ruled-out diseases from diagnostic consideration., Phen-Gen [22] is an alternative approach that employs a Bayesian framework to integrate semantic similarity calculation with proteomic and variant pathogenicity data. Although this procedure retains diagnostic intermediates and does not collapse phenotypes across diseases causally linked to variant genes, it still does not permit additional data input to update or redirect analysis based on initial results. In addition, this tool is more computationally intricate than PhenIX because it recruits proteinâprotein interaction (PPI) data into its analytic process. By including the protein interaction neighborhood in the variant analysis, Phen-Gen relaxes the distinction between matching a catalog of known causal variant genes and the more exploratory process of disease gene discovery. PHIVE is another algorithm that combines variant pathogenicity scores and catalogs with phenotype similarity analysis using human and mouse data to rank variants, while hiPHIVE uses human, mouse, and other model organism data to do so [23, 24]. Alternatively, eXtasy ranks variants by combining input phenotype similarity scores with scores computed between input genotype data and âfusedâ human and non-human genomic data, whereas Phevor combines input phenotype data with data from human and non-human ontologies to reprioritize externally pre-computed ranks [25, 26]. As with Phen-Gen, the inclusion in these analyses of gene-to-phenotype data from non-human sources may blur the line between disease gene discovery and clinical application. Other tools, such as PhenoDB [12, 13, 27] and PhenoTips [14, 28], facilitate the collection, classification, analysis, and sharing of clinical indication data, but they do not provide a phenotypically supported connection to particular variants detected in individual patients., Another challenge for computational tools is the interactive integration of diagnostic or biomedical expertise into the variant analysis process. Aside from brief initial configuration settings, most available tools execute variant prioritization in a single step starting from initial user input. Such approaches limit users from exercising medical judgment to constrain, update, or curate algorithmically determined initial results [17, 18, 21]., We hypothesized that molecular diagnostics could be improved through the application of a transitive prioritization scheme that links phenotypes to variants through medically recognized disease intermediates (Fig. 1c). Moreover, we hypothesized that by coupling this prioritization to a visual and interactive user interface, we could better recruit usersâ expertise to improve the diagnostic process beyond that of methods driven by computational algorithms alone. To pursue this approach, we developed novel web-based software employing methods from statistical visualization, software engineering, and semantic similarity analysis. We assessed our tool using the existing OMIM catalog mapped to the HPO [19]. We examined the ability of our scheme to recover known substructures in this catalogâin particular, its ability to distinguish disease classes as previously defined by the Human Disease Network (HDN) [29], as well as the OMIM Phenotypic Series [18, 29, 30]. We then applied our method to exome variant data previously analyzed by the Baylor Miraca Genetics Laboratory (BMGL) [31]. Our work demonstrates that the visual interactive approach is practical and produces results that closely match those of expert review, while simultaneously extending the framework of semantic-similarity-based analysis. We also elaborated this tool with a clearly separated function for variant discovery driven by semantic similarity methods. Collectively, these advances represent important contributions in the area of algorithms and software development for genome-wide variant analysis., Semantic similarity is a computational technique that compares sets of terms within a domain of knowledge. The technique relies on controlled vocabularies, such as ontologies, to compute approximate matches between queries and related vocabulary terms [32]. In the diagnostic context of human clinical phenotype analysis, semantic similarity calculations quantitatively compare patient phenotype term sets to sets defined by a catalog of known diseases or syndromes. We used as the substrate for our calculations the HPO mapping of the OMIM catalog, which provides descriptions of thousands of known genetic diseases and the corresponding genes in which causative variants have been observed [20, 30, 33â35]., A variety of semantic scoring methods have been developed. These scoring methods can be broadly grouped into two primary categories: (a) scoring approaches that use the ontological topology alone and (b) approaches which explicitly depend on catalog annotations to the ontology. Topology-only scores focus exclusively on the relationship structures between terms within an ontology (e.g., the HPO) [36]. Similarities are determined by traversing the directed acyclic graph to compute characteristics of shared ancestry and descendants between collections of nodes comprising queries and the target database. One such method is the GO-Universal method that functions by determining the âtopological reachabilityâ of each ontological term. Distinctly, annotation-based methods compute scores based on catalog annotations to an ontology. Of particular importance for these annotation-based scores is the concept of information contentâa logarithmic transformation of rareness of annotations at or below each term as determined by association of the knowledge catalogs (e.g., the set of OMIM diseases) to the ontology., To compute annotation-based similarities, we used a version of the Resnik method [37], as symmetrized by KÃ¶hler, et al. [20]. In what follows, let Dâ=âan annotated disease, Qâ=âa queried phenotype term set, d{t}â=âset of diseases annotated with term t, A{t}â=âset of terms t and all their respective ancestors, C{t}â=âset of terms t and all their respective children, and ||x||â=âquantity of elements in set x. Let N be the total number of disease in the catalog that are annotated to the ontology. The symmetrized Resnik calculation is defined:$$ {S}_R\left(D,Q\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(avg\left[\sum_{t_1\in D}\underset{t_2\in Q}{max}\left[\underset{t_j\in A\left\{{t}_1\right\}{\displaystyle \cap }A\left\{{t}_2\right\}}{max}\left[ log\kern0.28em \left(\frac{\parallel d\left\{C\left\{{t}_j\right\}\right\}\parallel }{N}\right)\right]\right]\right]\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(avg\left[\sum_{t_1\in Q}\underset{t_2\in D}{max}\left[\underset{t_j\in A\left\{{t}_1\right\}{\displaystyle \cap }A\left\{{t}_2\right\}}{max}\left[ log\kern0.28em \left(\frac{\parallel d\left\{C\left\{{t}_j\right\}\right\}\parallel }{N}\right)\right]\right]\right]\right) $$
                        , We also implemented an ancestral term overlap (ATO) method for computing semantic similarity. This method sums the unique overlap between pairs of phenotype sets, including their ontological ancestry. The ATO differs from the previously reported term overlap method [38] in that all ontological nodes shared between a pair of phenotype sets are included in the calculation:$$ {S}_O\left(D,Q\right)=\kern2mm \parallel A\left\{{t}_i\in D\right\}\cap A\left\{{t}_j\in Q\right\}\parallel $$
                        , In an effort to optimize resolution of differences among scored diseases, we examined weighting schemes to extend the ATO by using catalog information content [37] and weights determined by the topological information specified for the GO-Universal method [39]. We used the R statistical programming language to implement our calculations [40]. Because annotation to a knowledge catalog is required for calculation of the catalog-based information content, we excluded from catalog-weighted similarity analysis all HPO terms for which there exist no annotations to the OMIM catalog. Conversely, owing to the nonlinearly decaying nature of the GO-Universal calculation, a âreachabilityâ topological position characteristic TPC of 0 was computed for 322 low-depth HPO terms, resulting in an infinite topological information content TICâ=ââlog(TPC). We compensated for this by manually assigning to these terms a TIC of 2.225074âÃâ10â308, the machine minimum for the R language., We analyzed known collections of similar disease classes previously and independently defined as disease classes by the OMIM Phenotypic Series and the HDN [29, 30, 41]. Hypothesizing that diseases should be highly similar within classes, but distinguishable between classes, we used Resnik semantic similarity to calculate average scores between disease pairs within the same classes and compared these scores to those between pairs across different classes. For each class, we computed as a signal-to-noise ratio the quotient of mean within-class similarity and mean between-class similarity., The phenotypic component of the input, or query, to our analysis is a set of HPO terms describing the clinical presentation of a patient. The genotypic component is a set of genes or gene variants. This genotype may be provided as a simple gene list or in the form of a variant call file (VCF), typically generated as a summary of next-generation sequencing results. The provided list is expected to be filtered to remove common variants (e.g., >1 % population minor allele frequency [MAF]) or restricted to variant classes known to be inactivating mutations (e.g., frameshift or nonsense). Although our software is informed by the ExAC database (v0.3) [42] to annotate variants with observed frequencies, our software is not currently intended to perform this variant-frequency-based filtering step, but expects this processed content as input., To facilitate construction of query phenotype sets from raw clinical notes, we used the Bio-Lark Concept Recognizer application programming interface to provide natural language processing for automated extraction of HPO terms from input clinical presentation text narratives [43]. We enabled automated export of these results in our software to use these extracted phenotypes in subsequent semantic similarity analysis., We used semantic similarity and HPO annotations to estimate scores describing similarities of an input query to the 7,746 OMIM diseases defined in terms of the HPO phenotypes [19, 30, 44]. As described above, the phenotypic input to our analysis is a set of HPO characteristics, such as those observed during clinical examination of a patient or provided as indications for testing. To calculate diagnostic rankings of disease, we compute similarity scores via Resnik, ATO, ATO weighted by the GO-Universal information content, or ATO weighted by annotation-based information content algorithms. For each query, scores are computed for 7,746 diseases. We optionally limit the ranked disease list to diseases that also have OMIM Morbidmap [30] annotations, are restricted to particular genetic models (e.g., have only dominant or recessive inheritance), contain user-defined required phenotypes, or are causally linked in OMIM Morbidmap to genes identified as having candidate variations in the patient., We use a transitive closure approach to infer scores for the input variant gene set based on scores matching phenotype queries to disease. The scores are restricted to diseases in the catalog that are mapped by OMIM to genes harboring variants in the input set. For all diseases d{G} cataloged to result from variants in a gene G, we use an integrative function F to determine the transitive diagnostic relevance score S
                           T
                   for G against phenotype query Q by aggregating the d{G} similarity scores:$$ {S}_T\left(G,Q\right)=F\left(\underset{D_i\in d\left\{G\right\}}{\mathrm{S}}\left({D}_i,\mathrm{Q}\right)\right) $$
                        , We tested the mean, maximum, and sum as aggregation alternatives for F. To permit comparison between the transitive prioritization approach and alternatives, we implemented the direct gene scoring approach used by Phenomantics [21], which analyzes the HPO term-to-gene annotations, and that used by PhenIX [18], which analyzes the unions of phenotypes collapsed from all diseases associated with each gene via the OMIM Morbidmap [30]., Our software implements an optional feature to impose constraints determined by models of inheritance of genetic disease. This feature rules out differential intermediate diseases whose variant attributes do not meet inheritance requirements. For autosomal dominant disease, a single heterozygous variation is sufficient to cause disease; when recessive disease is suspected, both copies of an autosomal gene must be impacted for disease to result. Invoking the logic of the recessive model, the software restricts differential matching consideration to diseases causally linked to genes with homozygous variation or where compound heterozygous variation is possible based on the presence of two or more qualified variants within a gene. Once imposed, the inheritance model dictates disease filtering that transitively propagates to variant prioritization in the tool. The default mode of our software imposes no constraint for suspected model of inheritance., To create a global visualization of all 7,746 phenotype-annotated diseases in the OMIM catalog, approximating their similarities to each other and to individual patients, we applied classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) to semantic similarity calculations. MDS is a well-established statistical procedure that has been extensively documented [45] and requires semantic-similarity-derived dissimilarities as input. To transform similarity to dissimilarity, we subtracted each score from the maximum observed score, so that the maximum similarity between a pair of diseases has a corresponding dissimilarity of 0 and the minimum similarity has the largest dissimilarity. MDS determines a low-dimensional projection as output. This procedure renders the nâÃân dissimilarity matrix into an nâÃâk matrix, and for kââ¤â3 can be visualized as a low-dimensional best-fit map of OMIM diseases [45]., To contextualize a patient on this map, we calculated a convex combination of coordinates as the similarity-weighted location determined by nearest m semantic neighbors (e.g., the top five diseases most similar to the query). To make the weights sum to one, weights of each neighbor are determined by dividing each disease similarity by the sum of similarities of the k-nearest neighbors. The choice of m is a user-defined parameter, defaulted at 5., To create a local visualization of only the top n semantic disease matches to a phenotype query, we constructed an alternate two-dimensional visual display. This local map utilizes distance from the center to strictly represent diseases according to their exact similarities to the query. We place the query itself at the origin and linearly transform disease similarity scores into dissimilarity distances via the equation below. In what follows, the radius r
                           D
                   of disease D is calculated as a function of the similarity S of a query Q to itself and to D.$$ {r}_D=\frac{S\left(Q,Q\right)-S\left(Q,D\right)}{S\left(Q,Q\right)} $$
                        , The circumferential placement of diseases is determined by a one-dimensional MDS analysis of the n candidate diseases and represents the best one-dimensional approximation of the similarities of the n candidates to each other. To circumferentially spread the n candidates according to their similarities to each other, we scale the observed range of MDS across 360 degrees. To overlay attribute data for input variants in genes causally linked to the n candidates by the OMIM Morbidmap [30], we logarithmically scale candidate point size by variant frequency in the ExAC database [42] and linearly scale candidate point color by variant pathogenicity score computed by MutationTaster [46]. We manually assign a pathogenicity score of 1 to all exonic frameshift variants for which MutationTaster scores are not returned. Owing to its appearance, we refer to this local two-dimensional representation as a âradar plot.â, The identification of differential intermediate disease rankings in our transitive prioritization approach presents a unique opportunity for clinicians to interact with and curate results through our visual tool. Via the toggle interface embedded into the radar map of our interactive software, users can click diseases to âexcludeâ from the differential the candidates that they are able to rule out. Subsequently, the variant-associated ranking of diseases excluded or âruled outâ from diagnostic consideration are not included in the calculation of gene-level scores, directly modifying the transitive prioritization of variants., To enhance this curatorial process, we implement a âhovered diseaseâ functionality to provide an instantaneous, detailed display of input variants in genes associated with the hovered disease as well as available MAF and variant pathogenicity data. The hover function also presents for the disease the complete set of known HPO phenotype associations, that is, the subset of phenotypes shared between the disease and query, incorporating ontological ancestry to perform approximate matches between phenotypes., Analysis of phenotype and genotype queries can narrow the differential to a subset of disease candidates that are distinguished by particular phenotypic characteristics. We implemented a procedure to propose that such diagnostically informative phenotypes be considered for addition to the query. For each phenotype query, we calculate these suggestion characteristics as the rarest non-query phenotypes annotated to the diseases most similar to the query., We evaluated the performance of our transitive prioritization approach on the exome variants reported for a previously published cohort of genetic disease patients [31]. We obtained the detailed data from the Whole Genome Laboratory at BCM, now BMGL. Patient phenotype information was encoded into the HPO by manual review of input clinical forms for 245 cases. Filtered variant gene sets were obtained for 49 (96.1 %) of the 51 cases with reported diagnoses and 158 (81.4 %) of the 194 cases without reported diagnoses. Allele-specific variant details were obtained from Exome VCF files for 47 (92.2 %) of the 51 cases with reported diagnoses and 157 (81.0 %) of the 194 cases without reported diagnoses. For each of these cases, we integrated the encoded phenotype data with the VCF data to compute transitive prioritization ranks for the reported variant gene(s). We limited our transitive evaluation to the 47 solved cohort cases with (1) reported molecular diagnoses of variants in OMIM Morbidmap [30] genes, (2) exome data available in VCF files (median quantity of variant genesâ=â464), and (3) signed-out variant cataloged in ClinVar [17]. For analysis by our program, âOMIM Explorerâ (OE), gene symbols were extracted from VCF data and ranked via transitive prioritization; for HPO-direct and Morbidmap-collapse analysis, these gene symbols were ranked directly via Resnik semantic similarity; and for comparator tool analysis, case phenotype and VCF data were provided to Phen-Gen [22], eXtasy [25], PhenIX [18], PHIVE [23], and hiPHIVE [24] to rank variants. To convert gene aliases into approved HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee gene symbols for comparator analysis, we used the org.Hs.eg.db package (November 2015 release) for the R statistical programming language. This step was accomplished by mapping each gene symbol to its Entrez Gene identifier and then mapping the Entrez identifier back to the corresponding official gene symbol. This approach was used to check and remap gene symbols as reported by the BMGL as well as those annotated by the comparator tools., Patients may present with variants in genes that are not cataloged as previously known to cause disease. We developed an algorithm for semantically driven disease gene discovery to provide a facility for discovering new gene-to-disease associations, an operation distinct from catalog-based variant prioritization. First, we transitively use patient phenotype-to-OMIM similarity scores to identify the set of genes mapped to diseases most similar to the patient phenotypes. We then use an external knowledge sourceâin our case, the PINA 2.0 PPI network [47]âto identify candidate genes as those genes that are variant in the patient and highly connected to the training genes. We explored a variety of scores to rank candidates, including quantity of connections to training genes and percentage of total connections of a candidate that are training genes. The latter determines the default ordering of gene results in our tool., Variant frequency data were obtained from the ExAC Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC, v0.3), Cambridge, MA, USA [42]. Variant pathogenicity data was computed by MutationTaster and accessed via the Bioconductor package rfPred [46, 48]., We used RStudio Shiny [49], a web application framework for the R statistical programming language, to create an interactive, stateful implementation of our transitive variant prioritization and disease gene discovery workflow. We have named this novel software âOMIM Explorerâ (OE) and made it available at http://âwww.âomimexplorer.âcom. Links at the site also provide access to detailed tutorial videos describing the intended use of software features and providing step-by-step instructions., The state of an OE session includes the visualization settings, discovery settings, phenotype sets, variant sets, free text clinical summary content, and user-supplied curation to exclude specific disease from the differential. The state of an OE session determines the ranking of diseases, variants, and disease gene discovery candidates via the semantic-similarity-based transitive closure logic. Changes in session state immediately propagate to changes in the ranking of diseases and variants. Users can save, download, and share OE session files. These files can also be archived for future use., To assess the performance of semantic similarity, we conducted analyses using known classes of related disease defined by the OMIM Phenotypic Series and the HDN classes. We restricted analysis to Phenotypic Series groups comprising six or more disease entries that were annotated to the HPO, ensuring meaningful comparisons [30]. We performed within-versus-between calculations for these disease classes. We found that within-class similarities were substantially higher than those between classes: signal-to-noise ratios were consistently well above one, indicating strong signal in the semantic scores. The mean similarities between classes were consistently low and uncorrelated with class composition. We observed similar tendencies with disease groups defined by the HDN [29] (Additional file 1: Figure S1A, B)., The differential of potential disease diagnoses is essential to the logic of transitive prioritization. We hypothesized that visual engagement with these diseases would clarify their role and help improve molecular diagnostics and disease gene discovery. We used MDS of our high-dimensional similarity calculations in semantic space to generate a low-dimensional projectionâa global map in visual spaceâof the 7,746 diseases in the OMIM catalog annotated with HPO phenotypes, making inter-disease relationships easier to conceptualize (Fig. 2a). The resulting approximate visualization of the relationships between all pairs of diseases and between each disease and the case successfully maintained the within-group relationships for known HDN and OMIM Phenotypic Series disease classes in semantic similarity space (Additional file 2: Figure S2). Additionally, we observed in three-dimensional visual space the colocation of strictly-defined Phenotypic Series classes (e.g., specific eye and skeletal diseases) within their more broadly defined HDN class counterparts (e.g., all eye and skeletal diseases, respectively) (Additional file 3: Figure S3).
                      Fig. 2
                        Visual representations of differential disease spectra. In this case selected from a retrospective genetic disease cohort, bradykinesia, developmental regression, dystonia, motor delay, delayed speech and language development, and ptosis were reported. a The global map: a visual map representation of the relationships between the phenotypic features of the case (yellow triangle) and all 7,746 cataloged Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) diseases (gray circles). The two-dimensional space x,y is defined by the first two multidimensional scaling (MDS) components computed from Resnik similarities between all pairs of diseases. A projected map location is calculated for the case via a weighted convex combination of the coordinates of the diseases with the top five similarities to the complete patient phenotypes. The genotypic spectrum of disease for the case, comprising the 174 diseases with known causes in genes variant in the filtered patient exome, is highlighted in orange and is clustered throughout the visual space. b The local/radar map: an improved visual map representation of the relationships between the phenotypic features of the selected clinical case and the 174 genotypic spectrum diseases. The case is placed at the center of the map. The circumferential disease distribution across 360 degrees Î¸ is a linear scaling of the first MDS component computed from Resnik similarities between all pairs of diseases. Radial dissimilarity distance r is computed for each disease as the linear transformation of its similarity to the patient phenotypes. The size and color of disease points indicate the ExAC [42] and MutationTaster [46] pathogenicity of case variants harbored in genes causally linked to top differential intermediate diseases. The map can be progressively filtered to reflect mandatory aspects of clinical phenotype and genotype or manual curation of differential intermediates, as performed by clinicians
                      , We projected into this map a case from our published exome cohort [31], in which bradykinesia, developmental regression, dystonia, motor delay, delayed speech and language development, and ptosis were reported. We computed coordinates for the case location as the convex combination of the coordinates of the five diseases most similar to the reported phenotypes. We then identified an ordered differential of diseases potentially causing the observed phenotypes in the case by highlighting all 174 diseases linked to filtered exome variant data. We linked the diseases to variants through OMIM Morbidmap [30] indications that suggested the 174 diseases were previously observed to be caused by variants in genes that also contained potentially pathogenic rare variant alleles in the personal genome of the patient (Fig. 2a). Overall, global map projections were relatively accurate (Additional file 4: Figure S4A), and allowed for simultaneous representation of the proband, together with all 7,746 annotated diseases. We observed, however, that diseases very similar to the reported phenotypes in semantic space were neither consistently nor sufficiently close in visual space, and vice versa (Additional file 4: Figure S4B). In conjunction with our convex combination coordinate projection, the MDS-inherent mathematical compromises responsible for these inadequacies therefore yielded maps that were too inaccurate for inferring exact diagnoses from visual relationships between a projected patient and differentials., To remedy the limitations of the global map, we developed the local âradar mapâ alternative display. This plot places the top differential intermediate diseases at semantically accurate dissimilarity distances from the phenotype input for a case (Fig. 2b). It also presents the approximate semantic similarity relationships among candidates as determined by one-dimensional MDS, which is represented in the circumferential spacing of points. The one-dimensional MDS retains relatively accurate approximations of the relationships that exist among the diseases. Furthermore, rather than highlighting a subset of the entire catalog corresponding to the input genotypic and phenotypic spectra of diseases, the radar map progressively filters its contents to these spectra as defined by the user and modifies both the size and color of disease points to represent disease similarity to the patient, the MAF and pathogenicity of input variants in causally associated genes, and manual curation of differential intermediate diseases performed by clinicians., Of the 245 genetic disease cases in a retrospective cohort of individuals referred for whole exome sequencing, we analyzed the 51 for which a molecular diagnosis was reported [31]. The molecularly diagnosed cases tended to have more phenotypes and higher similarities to the OMIM disease catalog, while those undiagnosed tended to have higher quantities of variant genes after frequency and synonymy filtering (Fig. 3aâc). However, both classes of case were equally distributed in the visual space of the global disease map (Fig. 3d). For 47 of these 51 cases, the reported variant genes were associated with diseases via the OMIM Morbidmap [30]. With the assistance of the Bio-Lark Concept Recognizer [43], we manually reviewed the clinical notes for these 47 solved cases and updated their phenotype annotations to a more recent instance of the HPO. We used these updated annotations to compute cumulative distribution curves to evaluate the performance of OE across each of the 47 solved cases (Fig. 3f). We employed our transitive maximum as the integrative aggregation function because the maximum, rather than mean or sum, associated disease similarity score determined gene ranks that best matched those generated by the diagnostic laboratory (Fig. 3e). We observed that our transitive maximum prioritization approach implemented in OE computed median ranks of 2 via the term overlap method and a median of 3 via symmetrized Resnik similarities for the previously reported variants in these cases (Fig. 3f). Given that the median quantity of filtered variant genes identified in each of the 47 cases was 464 (Fig. 3c), the transitive maximum overlap and Resnik similarity approaches assigned to the reported variants median ranks in the top 1 % of all filtered variants (Fig. 3f).
                      Fig. 3
                        Solved and unsolved cases in the BMGL cohort. In 245 exome cases, 51 had reported molecular diagnoses. The solved cases tended to have (a) more Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) phenotypes, including ontological parent terms (Wilcoxon pâ=â0.0302); b higher average similarity to the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) catalog (Resnik similarity, Wilcoxon pâ=â0.0387); and (c) lower quantities of filtered variant (Wilcoxon pâ=â0.2177). d Visualization. Multi-dimensional scaling representation of the 51 solved (yellow spheres) and 194 unsolved (red spheres) cohort cases in a three-dimensional map of all 7,746 cataloged OMIM diseases (gray spheres). Solved and unsolved cases appear similarly distributed in the visual space. e Transitive method comparison. Across the 47 solved cases with reported Morbidmap genes, we tested maximum, mean, and sum as aggregation function alternatives; semantic similarity was calculated using symmetrized Resnik, unweighted ancestral overlap, and versions of ancestral overlap weighted by OMIM catalog information content and the topological information specified for the GO-Universal method [39]. Globally, the transitive maximum achieved the lowest median rank. f Comparison of relative performance. Phenotype and filtered genotype data for 47 cohort cases with reported molecular diagnoses were analyzed via the transitive maximum OMIM Explorer algorithms, phenotype-collapsing alternative algorithms, and comparator tools. A minor allele frequency (MAF) filter of 1 % MAF was applied in PhenIX, PHIVE, and hiPHIVE. Because eXtasy limits the quantity of phenotypic inputs to 10, we supplied eXtasy with only up to the 10 phenotypes with the highest information content (i.e., rareness in the OMIM catalog) scores for each case. Via OMIM Explorer, transitive maximum aggregation (Resnik) returned a top ranking for 16/47â=â34.04 % of the cohort and a ranking in the top five for 30/47â=â63.83 %; the overall best alternative, PhenIX, returned a top ranking for 15/47â=â31.91 % and a ranking in the top five for 24/47â=â51.06 %
                      , We compared the performance of the OE transitive maximum to that of Phen-Gen [22], eXtasy [25], PhenIX [18], PHIVE [23], and hiPHIVE [24]. Because the latter three were implemented via Exomiser, which allows for variant filtration by MAF, we applied a filter of 1 % MAF. Because eXtasy limits the quantity of phenotypic inputs to 10, we input the phenotypes with the top 10 information content scores to eXtasy for each of the 47 cases analyzed. We observed that for our cohort, OE returned scores for reported variant genes for more cases and had lower median ranks for the reported genes than did four of the five comparator tools. Phen-Gen failed to return scores for the clinically reported gene variants in 32 of the 47 cases (68.09 %); however, when Phen-Gen returned scoring results for the reported gene variants, it performed the best among all tools, with a median rank of 1.5 across these 15 of 47 cases (31.91 %). We also observed that the OE Resnik transitive maximum algorithm outperformed the best-overall-performing comparator tool, PhenIX, which yielded a median rank of 5 for the reported results on the test cases. OE returned a top ranking for the causative variant in 16 of the 47 cases (34.04 %) and a ranking in the top five for 30 out of 47 cases (63.83 %), while PhenIX returned a top ranking for 15 out of 47 (31.91 %) and a ranking in the top five for 24 out of 47 (51.06 %; Additional file 5: Figure S5 and Additional file 6: Table S1)., The radar plot implements curatorial interactivity using semantic similarity to identify candidate diagnoses. This plot presents accurate semantic similarity relationships of cases to differential disease candidates and visually distributes them according to their pairwise relationships. The web-based interactivity of this plot provides heads-up display information identifying each candidate, describing its phenotypic match to the query and distinction from alternate candidates, and presents corresponding variant information. To examine the plotâs performance in detail, we analyzed a single solved case from the retrospective cohort [31]. The patient in that case exhibited phenotypes of sinus bradycardia, pericardial effusion, delayed central nervous system myelination, epileptic encephalopathy, gastroesophageal reflux, encephalopathy, microcephaly, intellectual disability, and seizures. Whole exome sequencing of DNA extracted from whole blood led to the identification of 928 candidate variants in 837 genes, after filtering for variant frequency and changes to protein coding. Of these genes, 145 were cataloged in the OMIM Morbidmap [30] to harbor disease-causing variants. The BCM diagnostic laboratory reported as potentially causal a nonsynonymous variant detected in the SCN8A gene, in which defects cause early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (MIM #614558) and cognitive impairment with or without cerebellar ataxia (MIM #614306) [31]., The transitive maximum similarity analysis used the overlap score to automatically assign a rank of 4 to SCN8A (Fig. 4a, f) by restricting the differential intermediate to the 229 diseases causally linked via the OMIM Morbidmap to genes variant in the patient exome (Fig. 4b, c). The OE visual curation interface was then used to manually enforce a mandatory phenotype filter, limiting the candidate differential to the 29 patient exome-linked diseases cataloged to present with the intellectual disability observed in the patient (Fig. 4d). Using medical knowledge to guide additional curation, 16 of these 29 diseases were further excluded from the differential intermediate for this case owing to the absence of their hallmark features in the patient, including short stature (microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism [MIM #210720], Carpenter syndrome [MIM #201000], Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome [MIM #180849], Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome [MIM #605130]); hand, foot, or nail abnormalities (Carpenter syndrome [MIM #201000], Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome [MIM #180849], Temple-Baraitser syndrome [MIM #611816]); hypoglycemia (hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia [MIM #256450]); and brain or renal tumors (tuberous sclerosis 2 [MIM #613254]). These interactive curation steps improved the rank of the reported causal variant gene SCN8A from 4 to 1 (Fig. 4e, g). A similar performance was observed via a transitive maximum similarity analysis using the Resnik score (Additional file 7: Figure S6).

The patient in the case (yellow triangle) had indications of sinus bradycardia, pericardial effusion, delayed central nervous system (CNS) myelination, epileptic encephalopathy, gastroesophageal reflux, encephalopathy, microcephaly, intellectual disability, and seizures. The filtered exome identified candidate variation in 145 Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) Morbidmap genes. Variants were ranked via transitive maximum unweighted ancestral term overlap similarity. a Top candidate diseases (TCDs) of the differential intermediate. The 500 TCDs by semantic similarity (colored circles) are represented in the radar map. The reported SCN8A variant [ClinVar: SCV000245399.1] present in the patient is transitively ranked at 4 via the MIM #614558 rank of 13. b TCDs with cataloged causal variants. The 500 TCDs are filtered to those with causal gene variants cataloged in the OMIM Morbidmap. The SCN8A variant is transitively ranked at 4 via the MIM #614558 rank of 12. c Exome-linked TCDs. The Morbidmap TCDs are filtered to 229 diseases associated with genes variant in the patient. The SCN8A variant is transitively ranked 4 via the MIM #614558 rank of 4. d Exome TCDs with mandatory phenotypes. The 229 exome TCDs are filtered to 29 known to present with intellectual disability as observed in the patient. The SCN8A variant is transitively ranked 3 via the MIM #614558 rank of 3. e Interactive curation of exome TCDs. Medical knowledge is used to rule out 16 of the 29 remaining TCDs from the differential owing to the absence of their hallmark features.

                      , If no adequate diagnostic match is identified via the similarity-driven transitive variant prioritization approach, we provide a novel phenotypeâgene association discovery tool that uses the neighborhood of diseases most phenotypically similar to patient phenotypes to determine a phenotypic neighborhood training gene set. We then use prior knowledge in the form of PPI networks to identify candidate genes both variant in the patient and connected in âgenomic-annotation spaceâ to the phenotypically implicated training gene set. We used the PINA2 PPI network to perform this analysis [47]. To evaluate the performance of our PPI-based transitive disease gene discovery approach, we applied its algorithm to the HPO representation of OMIM diseases and their corresponding genotypic attributes recorded in the OMIM Morbidmap [35]. We observed that the protein products of genes causative of diseases nearest in semantic similarity space are also closer in PPI space than those of typical disease genes (KolmogorovâSmirnov pâ<â2.2âÃâ10â16) (Fig. 5a), suggesting the utility of such an approach. A validation example of using the tool to âdiscoverâ a gene known to cause human diseases is presented in Fig. 5b.
                      Fig. 5
                        Disease gene discovery via semantic similarity and proteinâprotein interaction network. a Our semantically driven disease gene discovery approach using external omic knowledge. This approach establishes the semantic neighborhood of a patient to identify a relevant known disease gene set, and then recruits prior knowledge of relevant geneâgene relationships to intersect with patient variations. This integration of the disease catalog with omic knowledge results in potential variant discovery and phenotypic extension of known disease genes. As shown in this example, a patient phenotype query determines training genes: those variant in the patient and known to contain variants causing cataloged diseases most similar to the query. The biological subnetwork implicated by these training genes is then realized in âomic space.â For this example, proteomic space, as defined by the PINA2 proteinâprotein interaction network, is used. This process identifies candidate genes that are variant in the patient and connected to training genes in the protein interaction network. In this figure, an additional constraint has been applied, in which genes must directly interact with at least two training genes to be considered candidates. b To validate this procedure we performed a global analysis across the entirety of Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). In protein interaction network space, the variant genes of nearest semantic neighbor diseases are typically closer to each other than to those of all diseases
                      , We implemented the algorithmic concepts described above into a software system. Our tool also implements the Bio-Lark natural language processing engine [43] to automatically extract HPO terms from clinical narratives for use in semantic similarity calculation, and a wordcloud feature that sizes each input query term according to its relative information content, in comparison to that of other input phenotype terms. Additionally, our tool supports session statefulness, which allows users to save and load their work and share it within collaborative diagnostic teams. Our tool was developed using the RStudio Shiny web application development framework [49]. Shiny uses the R statistical programming environment together with Node.js [50]. This platform allows Shiny, and software developed with it, to take advantage of an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which has little computational overhead. OE is an example of a data-intensive, real-time application running across distributed devices. The tool, and links to detailed tutorial videos of example use cases, are publically accessible at http://âwww.âomimexplorer.âcom., Genome-wide data interpretation is a central challenge of genomic medicine, and will likely continue to be for years to come. Biomedical software plays a fundamental role in meeting this challenge. We have developed an interactive visual tool to meet this challenge. Our tool is distinctive in several ways. First, our tool allows users to input clinical information as free-text notes that are translated into HPO terms. Second, our analytic approach uses transitive prioritization to rank subject phenotypes against their variant genes using the cataloged associations with known genetic diseases. Third, the tool allows users to update, or fine tune, these ranks using their medical expertise to rule out particular diseases or to impose phenotypic constraints or additional filters. Fourth, curation is driven by a novel visual interface that is both stateful and visually interactive. This visual and interactive approach is iterative, and therefore fundamentally different from previous work that has relied more on single-step computational analysis. Finally, our tool permits the saving of session files for sequential effort, archival, or data sharing., Although our work may increase the efficiency and effectiveness of human users, it is not a command line tool intended for automated high-throughput use in larger computational pipelines without the interaction of human users (Table 1). While we believe other alternatives in this space are better suited for full automation, such implementations may exclude the contribution of real-time, adaptive medical expertise from the variant prioritization process. Collectively, we believe that our approach better recruits biomedical and clinical experts into the variant analysis workflow, but with the tradeoff that this interactivity requires active input from users.Table 1

                  , Our tool uses transitive prioritization to link genetic variations to phenotypic traits through differential intermediate diseases. The retention of differential intermediate diseases plays an important role in the facilitation of our visualization scheme and curatorial process: because they can be visualized, users can exclude disease alternatives deemed diagnostically irrelevant. This curation can in turn further improve the performance of transitive prioritization. Importantly, algorithms such as PhenIX [18] employ phenotypic collapsing to map genes to phenotype sets. As depicted in Fig. 1b, collapsing phenotypes across diseases can result in potentially flawed semantic scores. Our results show that transitive prioritization has better performance and retains this curatorial functionality., The HPO [19] is a high dimensional feature space for representing the complexity of pathologies that are observed in human disease. Representing points in this space in a low-dimensional map is a difficult computational challenge. Our attempts to use classical MDS to represent these data reveal the challenge of dimension reduction for these data. Although the global plot reveals gross features of disease relationships, the error of inter-point distances in the low-dimensional projection results in loss of semantic relationships, making it difficult to use this global projection in diagnostics. As an alternative, we developed the radar plot. This local view retains an accurate representation of the semantic similarity of differential intermediate diseases to the caseâs phenotypes using distance from the proband placed at the center of the graphic. The relationships between diseases are used to construct an approximate circumferential arrangement of points. Research to explore other approaches to two-dimensional representations of semantic similarity is warranted., Our tool relies on semantic similarity to analyze patient indication content against genetic variation and prior knowledge. As in previous work, we employed the Resnik metric [37] in addition to alternatives. The Resnik method takes a weighted combination of lowest common ontological ancestor matches among query and target phenotypes to assign scores. A simpler approach, ATO [38], counts the unique overlap of terms, including their ontological ancestry. This simple overlap of terms performed better rank estimation in our analysis of reported human exomes (Fig. 3f). Although the Resnik similarity metric has been extensively employed in this field, our results suggest that alternative metrics should be explored, and we observe that Resnik might not be optimal in all situations. We propose that the Resnik score may suffer from certain limitations. First, to compute the similarity score, the information content of the least-commonly-annotated common ancestor phenotype across all pairs of query and disease phenotypes is averaged. This averaging can dilute or overestimate term contributions to scores for densely or sparsely phenotyped diseases because the quantities of terms annotated to each disease can vary. Second, the weighting of terms in the Resnik calculation uses information content, defined as the negative logarithm of frequency of an ontological term in the ancestry among all cataloged diseases [37]. This choice of weights may be suboptimal because of the strongly non-linear nature of the log-transformation that causes the most rare terms to have extremely high weights. Third, under Resnik, each query term makes an independent additive contribution to similarity, but the same nodes in the ontological tree may be recruited across multiple terms. Therefore, this additive approach permits the same nodes in the ontology to contribute to query scoring multiple times. This stands in contrast to the more direct overlap approach in which each phenotype contributes only once to each score [38]., The approach presented in this paper does not explicitly use deleteriousness scores based on considerations from structural biology, such as those generated via PolyPhen or SIFT [51, 52], to transitively rank variant genes. It does, however, recruit variant pathogenicity scores and frequencies, and it represents this information in displays using the color and size, respectively, of radar plot points for diseases to which the variant host genes are causally linked. We include this content as metadata in the visual display so that users can incorporate it into their curation. Future extensions that more explicitly incorporate these approaches may further improve the accuracy of variant gene prioritization. These areas present opportunities for future research., An additional feature of our tool is discovery driven by the synthesis of semantic matching to the known catalog with prior gene knowledge in the form of protein interaction networks. The approach increases the likelihood of identifying possible disease-causing variants not matched to OMIM entries and of identifying novel gene-to-phenotype relationships that can be associated with existing disease genes. Our approach leverages known causal gene associations in phenotypic neighborhoods of top semantic matches to select phenotypically matched genes for discovery of candidates. This approach exploits known inter-gene relationships defined in the PINA2 PPI network [47]. Additional data sources, such as gene expression, gene annotation (GO), or transcription factor binding databases could be used to extend the power of phenotypically guided disease gene discovery [53â55]. This area also merits further inquiry., Our visual approaches represent a new scheme for variant prioritization in genome-wide diagnostics. We explored algorithmic alternatives, compared our work with other available software, and encapsulated this work in our novel tool, called OMIM Explorer. The tool is fundamentally structured around a visual map of known genetic diseases based on semantic similarity. Patient phenotype and variant information, as well as additional external information on variant class, frequency, and pathogenicity, are superimposed on this map. This approach provides visual guidance to the diagnostician or physician for evaluation. The tool also directs additional informative phenotyping, helps provide rationale for possible co-occurrence of multiple diagnoses, and facilitates the discovery of novel gene-to-phenotype associations. We validated our tool using existing catalogs of known diseases, and we evaluated performance using a previously published cohort of exome cases from the BMGL diagnostic laboratory [31]. Ultimately, this software promises to positively impact efficiency and communication between clinicians and molecular diagnostics laboratories.

                          Causal variant gene prioritization in solved clinical cohort cases and semantic algorithm score comparison. OE transitively computed a median rank of 3 (top 1 %) for host genes via maximum annotated Resnik similarity score, and 2 (top 1 %) via maximum ancestral overlap. As comparator metrics to the transitive prioritization approaches, we computed scores using direct HPO term-to-gene annotations and unions of phenotypes collapsed from the all diseases associated with each gene via the OMIM Morbidmap. The cumulative distribution curve demonstrates the quality of solutions within a given rank as the percentage of the 47 cases with variant genes correctly ranked at a given threshold. We report the median because it robustly separates the top half of a sample from the bottom half. The transitive maximum ancestral overlap method achieved the lowest median rank, while the transitive maximum OMIM catalog-weighted ancestral overlap method achieved the highest median rank percentile.

We asked our Section Editors to discuss the breakthroughs in their fields of expertise, and what these might mean for the future. As in previous years, exome and whole-genome sequencing are leading the way in our understanding of disease mechanisms, their diagnosis and treatment, while information about the protein products of the genome has also grown, driven by novel technological advances. Precision medicine is now taking off as an important topic in the public health sphere and in education, and no discussion of 2015 would be complete without a mention of the huge advances in gene editing technologies, the implications of which have dominated ethics and policy debate., Functional annotation of the human genome through gene discovery took a notable âleapâ in 2015 with insight into gene function provided using Mendelian genomics approaches, primarily exome sequencing, to study the specific rare variants underlying disease trait manifestation., The numbers of gene discovery publications are too numerous to single out any one; however, the UK Wellcome Trust Deciphering Developmental Disorders (WTDDD) [1, 2] and US National Human Genome Research Institute Centers for Mendelian Genomics (NHGRI CMG) [3] initiatives and other such efforts around the world are having a noticeable impact with direct and immediate clinical practice implications. The global impact of this work on human genetics, genomics and the practice of clinical medicine is palpable. Personal genome information and individual variation based on whole exome studies is increasingly utilized to identify a molecular diagnosis and help formulate a differential clinical diagnosis, particularly for diagnostic dilemmas that have evaded an etiologic diagnosis by conventional clinical approaches. Genome Medicine dedicated an entire issue (July 2015) to this topic with notable papers describing advances in emergency medical genomes [4] and reviewing the integration of clinical phenotypic information into the analyses of whole exome study data [5]., This effort to functionally annotate the human genome has been greatly facilitated by a web-based platform for rare disease gene discoveryâthe Matchmaker Exchange [6]âthat has enabled the worldwide connection of families with rare diseases and the clinicians caring for them to contribute to this effort for humanity. Such rare variant studies are also beginning to yield insights into complex traits such as scoliosis and neuropathy, and the genetic architecture and genetic models potentially underlying common and complex traits including compound inheritance [7] and mutational burden [8]., As we look forward in 2016 the clinical data available that may enhance biological research efforts will likely continue to explode. More and more we may find that model organism studies look toward human genetics and medical genetics data to provide important insights into biology and in so doing reveal fundamental understanding of disease processes. Moreover, such new understanding may foment novel approaches to disease management and potentially enable therapeutic intervention for rare variant associated disease.

                  , There is increasing awareness of pharmacogenomics (PGx) as a key component in personalized medicine. A recent evaluation of all 517 medications labeled by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) between 1995 and August 2014 demonstrated that 15 % of these drugs include PGx information which covers pharmacokinetic (for example, drug metabolism/transport) and pharmacodynamic targets [9]. Warnings are related to therapeutic indications, posology and method of administration, and contraindications, thereby directly influencing treatment decisions. Predominantly anticancer drugs are affected by these PGx labels., Major efforts have been initiated to implement genetic testing of actionable pharmacogenes into clinical practice. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), a group of international experts, is working on evidence-based guidelines which are standardized and provide PGx data to individualize the prescribing of drugs [10]. However the clinical implementation process is hampered by several issues such as the reluctance of professional societies, clinicians, and reimbursement organizations. One major concern is the strict request for prospective controlled clinical trials demonstrating state-of-the art evidence for the superiority of an individualized approach for drug prescription based on pharmacogenetic testing. Regarding this issue, a landmark randomized clinical trial has been published corroborating the clinical utility of upfront genetic testing for the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene TPMT to avoid hematotoxicity associated with thiopurine drugs, such as azathioprine [11]. Convincing evidence had already been established in the 1990s that patients with decreased thiopurine methyltransferase enzyme activity and standard dosing of thiopurines are at risk of developing myelosuppression. Nevertheless the progress of clinical implementation is still slow and hopefully will derive benefit from this recent trial. Another example is dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) PGx and drug use of fluoropyrimidines (for example, fluorouracil). Just 30 years after the first description of fatal outcome of fluorouracil administration due to DPYD deficiency, a meta-analysis in 2015 has provided strong evidence that several rare DPYD variants contribute to fluoropyrimidine-induced severe toxicity [12]. Although fluoropyrimidines are frequently prescribed, DPYD testing is still not officially recommended [10]., The vision of personalized medicine and PGx is rather complex and strategies are needed for better clinical implementation. The use of electronic clinical decision support (eCDS) like the US-initiative eMERGE (Electronic Medical Records and Genomics) will promote the progress of clinical implementation of PGx. However comprehensive and systematic phenotypic characterization of the patient, including diseases and drug therapy, by high-throughput technologies is mandatory. Computer-based, direct interview methods are available to assess the patientsâ phenotypes independent of physician input in a standardized manner [13]. Multi-omics data in addition to genomic information which may improve prediction of drug response will be routinely available in the near future. Thus systems-based approaches and drug-specific algorithms are required, a concept which is beyond eCDS tools. The translational, multidisciplinary, and facilitative role of clinical pharmacology may help to achieve this goal [14].

                  , In 2015, the USA launched the precision medicine initiative that includes two components: one focusing on cancer genomics and treatment, and one focusing on generating data on long-term health and disease in a national cohort research study of one million or more people [15]. While much of this initiative will take years to develop outputs for use in healthcare, a public health perspective is crucial to ensure the initiativeâs success in terms of representativeness, generalizability, implementation, and near-term deployment of already established evidence-based genomic findings to save lives and prevent disease [16]., The field of pathogen genomics continues to expand. Molecular technologies are being integrated into the diagnosis, treatment, and control of infections. For example, rapid metagenomic identification of viral pathogens in clinical samples can be accomplished by real-time nanopore sequencing analysis [17]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advanced Molecular Detection initiative is combining genome technologies with bioinformatics and epidemiology to enhance public health surveillance, investigations, and control of infectious diseases [18]. Pathogen genomics is becoming quite helpful globally; for example, in tracking the Ebola virus epidemic transmission in West Africa [19]., We also saw increasing applications of human genetics into public health programs. While genetics has been part of public health since newborn screening began in the 1960s, genetics is becoming a priority area for prevention and treatment of common chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease. A special 2015 issue of the journal Healthcare, focusing on implementation of public health genomics, presented data and information on a range of ongoing public health activities, including reducing the burden of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, screening children for familial hypercholesterolemia, and engaging medically underserved populations in family history education [20]., Because of the rapid evolution of genomic medicine, a crucial function in public health genomics is to identify evidence-based genomic applications that can improve health, inform and engage various stakeholders, and integrate genomics into ongoing public health programs [21]. To help with this daunting task, the CDC launched in 2015 the Public Health Genomics Knowledge Base in an effort to continue capturing evolving snapshots of the field while tracking the translational trajectory of genome-based discoveries into population health impact [22]., While the precision medicine initiative will take years to mature and lead to tangible discoveries and products, 2016 promises to be an exciting year for the intersection of precision medicine and population health. Some key areas to watch include: (1) developing more robust approaches to obtain empirical data on the impact of genomics and precision medicine on population health; (2) developing metrics for best practices on genomics and population health including indicators for successful implementation and outcomes; and (3) exploring key concepts for the development of âprecision public healthâ [23] beyond genomics, to include a variety of personal and environmental data for preventing disease and promoting health.

                  , I have chosen four articles published in 2015 that I feel either demonstrate the versatility of proteomic, metabolomic, or lipidomic approaches to medicine, or will have significant impacts as new approaches in the near future., While liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) dominates as a tool for both metabolomics and proteomics, users have to decide whether they will perform nontargeted, discovery approaches, which are at best semiquantitative in nature, or targeted approaches relying on triple quadrupole MS, which, while quantitative, only target a limited number of metabolites or peptides. Developments in 2015 have questioned these separate workflows. Guo and colleagues [24] describe an approach, termed sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH)-MS, to acquire the parent ion and fragmentation data of peptides produced from a tissue biopsy by varying the precursor isolation window in a sequential manner. Mass transitions associated with individual peptides are reconstructed in silico and produce spectra comparable to that acquired with a triple quadrupole in terms of specificity but with the global nature of a nontargeted approach. They illustrate this by detecting over 2000 proteins in biopsy samples from patients with renal cell carcinoma., Similar approaches can be used to reconstruct lipidomes, using the fact that all lipid species consist of a series of building blocks such as individual fatty acids and head groups. Ni and coworkers [25] describe a novel application to identify carbonylated lipid peroxidation products, which may be useful as biomarkers of a range of diseases including atherosclerosis, fatty liver disease, and reperfusion injury, using LipidXplorer software., One problem with new bioinformatic tools that limits their uptake is that they may be written in a variety of languages. Giacomoni and coworkers [26] borrow an approach from genomics to develop a web-based workflow for LC-MS-based metabolomics that links software from a variety of sources. Workflow4Metabolomics provides a virtual research environment built upon the Galaxy environment [27] linking together open source tools that allow users to completely process their data without extensive experience of the software or tools., Metabolomics, proteomics, and lipidomics are also delivering in terms of translational medicine. For example, Eiden and colleagues [28] used LC-MS-based lipidomics to identify biomarkers associated with a failure of adipose tissue function in lipodystrophic patients. They identified a characteristic alteration in triglyceride profiles caused by increased de novo lipogenesis in the liver as a consequence of ectopic fat deposition which may be applicable to identifying those with fatty liver in the general population. With new developments in tools and software we should see the range of these metabolomic, proteomic, and lipidomic biomarkers expand and make it into the clinic.

                  , 2015 has witnessed an acceleration of the convergence of big data and genomic medicine that supports the implementation of personalized medicine using systems biology approaches. These are now being developed globally through advanced education programs targeted at research and healthcare professionals as well as the public., These trends were discussed at the Big Data and Healthy Living Technologies Roundtable organized by BioHealth Computing and the European Scientific Institute, the training branch of CERN, in Archamps, France [29], and during the Big Data in Health CareâChallenges, Innovations and Implementation symposium organized by the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Medicine in Munsbach, Luxembourg [30]. On these two occasions, it became clear that, firstly, the real-life implementation of systems medicine to address important unmet healthcare needs requires novel curricula for the training of the new generation of scientists and medical doctors, and, secondly, that decades of expertise developed in other fields such as particle physics are available to support the development of open standards for the description and exchange of the variety of big data in health., In relation to the first issue, Siwo et al. highlighted [31] how cloud-computing and genetic testing are being combined in structured education programs to leverage the large genetic variation existing in Africa, thus bringing the continent to the forefront to explain genotypeâphenotypeâdisease relationships. The participants from academic, industrial and governmental organizations also recognized that the current inability to deal with the second widely debated issue, as discussed by Horvitz and Mulligan [32], may constitute a major roadblock in the development of personalized medicine internationally. Indeed, the diversity of legal and regulatory frameworks and the invalidation by the European Court of Justice of the United States Safe Harbor provisions for data transfer across the Atlantic [33] are introducing a high level of uncertainty. In this context, the introduction by Bahr and SchlÃ¼nder [34] of a code of practice for the secondary use of medical data in scientific research projects, and its consideration in the ongoing revision of the European Directive on Personal Data Protection, may provide a path toward harmonization of regulatory practices., Through the consolidation of these trends, 2016 should therefore see more advances toward the actual implementation of participatory, preventive, predictive, personalized (P4) systems medicine to understand wellness and tackle unmet medical needs worldwide.

                  , While many genomic policy issues continue to attract significant attention from both the academic community and the general public, the social and ethical challenges associated with the new gene-editing technology dominated in 2015., The prospect of being able to efficiently edit the human genomeâthrough the application of a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9âhas stirred debate about if and when the modification of the human germ line can ever be ethically justified. Some in the ethics community have called for a complete ban, fearing, inter alia, the unknown future consequences of altering the human genome. Those who support the cautious clinical application of gene editing note the potential to cure rare monogenic diseases [35]. The debate culminated in an international scientific summit held in Washington DC at the National Academy of Sciences, where it was suggested that research should continue butâat least for nowâa clinical application should not be attempted until governance, safety, and efficacy issues are resolved [36]. This was, in effect, a call for a voluntary moratorium on edits that could be inherited but also support for the research to continue. This conclusion fits with recommendations made by other entities, such as the International Society for Stem Cell Research and the Hinxton Group [37]. It should be noted that in some jurisdictions there are already laws in place that would have an impact on the clinical application of the emerging gene-editing technology. In my home country of Canada, for example, any procedure that results in the alteration of the germ line, even if done to cure a disease like Tay Sachs or Huntingtonâs, could be categorized as a criminal offence as per the relevant federal law [38]. Given the ongoing debate about the potential scientific and health benefits, the Canadian situation highlights the potential policy dilemmas created by the use of rigid legislative frameworks to regulate unpredictable areas of science., Another policy challenge that received attention in 2015 was the regulation of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing. In 2013, the California company 23andMe was prohibited by the US Food and Drug Administration from providing health-oriented testing to its consumers. But in 2015, the company was granted permission to start providing a limited array of services (for example, providing information about âcarrier statusâ for conditions like sickle-cell anemia and cystic fibrosis) [39], thus once again prompting questions about the potential health value (if any) and risks (if any) of these kinds of DTC services., 2016 will undoubtedly see the emergence of new ethical challenges, such as the regulation of the noninvasive prenatal testing market and the growing (and largely evidence-free) DTC genetic testing industry for lifestyle, fitness, and nutrition. But as the science continues to move forward quickly, gene editing seems likely to remain a dominant policy issue in 2016.

Substantial evidence now suggests that anti-tumor T cells recognize tumor somatic mutations, translated as single amino acid substitutions, as âneoantigensâ. These unique antigenic markers arise from numerous genetic changes, acquired somatically that are present exclusively in tumor (mutant) and not in normal (wild-type (WT)) cells [2]. Recent preclinical data indicate that these mutated proteins, upon processing and presentation in the context of MHC molecules expressed by antigen-presenting cells, can be recognized as ânon-selfâ by the immune system., Our previous work in murine sarcoma models was one of the first demonstrations of how somatic cancer mutations could be identified from massively parallel sequencing, and when considered in the context of MHC binding affinity, can predict tumor specific neoantigens [3]. A subsequent study further demonstrated that these neoantigens were the same epitopes recognized by anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 checkpoint blockade therapies and that peptide vaccines comprising neoantigens could provide prophylactic effects [4]. Several other studies have also characterized these neoantigens as being derived from somatically mutated genes in mouse [5] as well as in humans [6â9], and have shown that they can be recognized by T cells., While checkpoint blockade therapies have achieved tremendous success in the clinic, patient-specific vaccines still meet a clinical need in those patients that either do not respond, develop resistance, or cannot tolerate the associated side effects of checkpoint blockade drugs. The main paradigm behind the development of cancer vaccines rests on the assumption that if the immune system is stimulated to recognize neoantigens, it may be possible to elicit the selective destruction of tumor cells. Vaccines incorporate these neoantigen peptides with the aim of enhancing the immune systemâs anti-tumor activity by selectively increasing the frequency of specific CD8+ T cells, and hence expanding the immune systemâs ability to recognize and destroy cancerous cells. This process is dependent on the ability of these peptides to bind and be presented by HLA class I molecules, a critical step to inducing an immune response and activating CD8+ T cells [10]., As we move from vaccines targeting âsharedâ tumor antigens to a more âpersonalizedâ medicine approach, in silico strategies are needed to first identify, then determine which somatic alterations provide the optimal neoantigens for the vaccine design. Ideally, an optimal strategy would intake mutation calls from massively parallel sequencing data comparisons of tumor to normal DNA, identify the neoantigens in the context of the patientâs HLA alleles, and parse out a list of optimal peptides for downstream testing. At present, elements of this ideal strategy exist, but are not available as open source code to permit others to adopt these methods into cancer care strategies. This manuscript describes one such approach, and provides a link to open source code for end users., For example, to optimize identification and selection of vaccine neoantigens, several in silico epitope binding prediction methods have been developed [11â15]. These methods employ various computational approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) and are trained on binding to different HLA class I alleles to effectively identify putative T cell epitopes., There are also existing software tools (IEDB [16], EpiBot [17], EpiToolKit [18]) that compile the results generated from individual epitope prediction algorithms to improve the prediction accuracy with consensus methods or a unified final ranking. The current implementation of EpiToolKit (v2.0) also has the added functionality of incorporating sequencing variants in its Galaxy-like epitope prediction workflow (via its Polymorphic Epitope Prediction plugin). However, it does not incorporate sequence read coverage or gene expression information available from massively parallel sequencing datasets, nor can it compare the binding affinity of the peptide in the normal sample (WT) versus the tumor (mutant). Another multi-step workflow Epi-Seq [19] uses only raw RNA-Seq tumor sample reads for variant calling and predicting tumor-specific expressed epitopes., We report herein an open source method called pVAC-Seq that we developed to address the critical need for a workflow that assimilates and leverages massively parallel DNA and RNA sequencing data to systematically identify and shortlist candidate neoantigen peptides from a tumorâs mutational repertoire that could potentially be used in a personalized vaccine after immunological screening. This automated analysis offers the functionality to compare and differentiate the epitopes found in normal cells against the neoepitopes specifically present in tumor cells for use in personalized cancer vaccines, and the flexibility to work with any user-specified list of somatic variants. Preliminary versions of this pipeline were applied in mouse models of cancer to identify expressed mutations in cancer cells and characterize tumor-specific mutant peptides that drive T cell-mediated tumor rejection in mice with MCA-induced sarcomas [3, 4]. More recently, we used this pipeline in a proof-of-concept trial in melanoma patients, to identify the neoantigen peptides for use in dendritic cell-based personalized vaccines [20]., Our in silico automated pipeline for neoantigen prediction (pVAC-Seq) requires several types of data input from next-generation sequencing assays. First, the pVAC-Seq pipeline requires a list of non-synonymous mutations, identified by a somatic variant-calling pipeline. Second, this variant list must be annotated with amino acid changes and transcript sequences. Third, the pipeline requires the HLA haplotypes of the patient, which can be derived through clinical genotyping assays or in silico approaches. Having the above-mentioned required input data in-hand, pVAC-Seq implements three steps: performing epitope prediction, integrating sequencing-based information, and, lastly, filtering neoantigen candidates. The following paragraphs describe the analysis methodology from preparation of inputs to the selection of neoantigen vaccine candidates via pVAC-Seq (Fig. 1).
                    Fig. 1
                      Overview of the pipeline pVAC-Seq: This figure illustrates the methodological framework behind the pVAC-Seq pipeline. Starting with preparation of inputs, it consists of three main steps - epitope prediction, integration of sequencing information, and filtered candidate selection
                    , As described above, pVAC-Seq relies on input generated from the analysis of massively parallel sequencing data that includes annotated non-synonymous somatic variants that have been âtranslatedâ into mutant amino acid changes, as well as patient-specific HLA alleles. Importantly, these data can be obtained from any appropriate variant calling, and annotation pipeline and HLA typing approach. Here, we outline our preparatory steps to generate these input data [20]. Somatic variant analysis of exome sequencing datasets was performed using the Genome Modeling System (GMS) [21] for alignment and variant calling. In brief, BWA (version 0.5.9) [22] was used for alignment with default parameters, except that the number of threads was set to 4 (-t 4) for faster processing, and the quality threshold for read trimming to 5 (-q 5). The resulting alignments were de-duplicated via Picard MarkDuplicates (version 1.46) [23]., In cases where clinically genotyped HLA haplotyping calls were not available, we used in silico HLA typing by HLAminer (version 1) [24] or by Athlates [25]. HLA typing was performed on the normal (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), rather than the tumor sample. Though the two software tools were >85% concordant in our test data (unpublished data), it is helpful to use both algorithms in order to break ties reported by HLAminer (see below).I.
                        HLAminer for in silico HLA-typing using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data: When predicting HLA class I alleles from WGS data, we used HLAminer in de novo sequence alignment mode [26] by running the script HPTASRwgs_classI.sh, provided in the HLAminer download, with default parameters. (The download includes detailed instructions for customizing this script, and the scripts on which it depends, for the userâs computing environment.) For each of the three HLA loci, HLAminer reports predictions ranked in decreasing order by score, where âPrediction #1â and âPrediction #2â are the most likely alleles for a given locus. When ties were present for Prediction 1 or Prediction 2, we used all tied predictions for downstream neoepitope prediction. However, it should be noted that most epitope prediction algorithms, including NetMHC [13, 14], only work with an algorithm-specific subset of HLA alleles, so we are constrained to the set of NetMHC-compatible alleles. The current version NetMHC v3.4 supports 78 human alleles.
                       II.
                        Athlates for in silico HLA-typing using exome sequence data: We diverged from the recommended Athlates protocol at two points: (1) We performed the alignment step, in which exome sequence data from the normal tissue sample are aligned against reference HLA allele sequences present in the IMGT/HLA database [27], using BWA with zero mismatches (params : bwa aln -e 0 -o 0 -n 0) instead of NovoAlign [28] with one mismatch. (2) In the subsequent step, sequence reads that matched, for example, any HLA-A sequence from the database were extracted from the alignment using bedtools [29] instead of Picard. This procedure is resource-intensive, and may require careful resource management. Athlates reports alleles that have a Hamming distance of at most 2 and meet several coverage requirements. Additionally, it reports âinferred allelic pairsâ, which are identified by comparing each possible allelic pair to a longer list of candidate alleles using a Hamming distance-based score. We typically used the inferred allelic pair as input to subsequent steps in the neoepitope prediction pipeline.

We typically used the inferred allelic pair as input to subsequent steps in the neoepitope prediction pipeline., After alignments (and optional HLA typing) were completed, somatic mutation detection was performed using the following series of steps (Additional file 1: Figure S1): (1) Samtools [30, 31] mpileup v0.1.16 was run with parameters â-A -Bâ with default setting for the other parameters. These calls were filtered based on GMS âsnp-filter v1â and were retained if they met all of the following rules: (a) Site is greater than 10 bp from a predicted indel of quality 50 or greater; (b) The maximum mapping quality at the site is â¥40; (c) Fewer than three single-nucleotide variants (SNV) calls are present in a 10 bp window around the site; (d) The site is covered by at least three reads and less than 1âÃâ109 reads; and (e) Consensus and SNP quality is â¥20. The filtered Samtools variant calls were intersected with those from Somatic Sniper [32] version 1.0.2 (params: -F vcf q 1 -Q 15), and were further processed through the GMS âfalse-positive filter v1â (params: --bam-readcount-version 0.4 --bamreadcount-min-base-quality 15 --min-mapping-quality 40 --min-somatic-score 40). This filter used the following criteria for retaining variants: (a) â¥1% of variant allele support must come from reads sequenced on each strand; (b) variants must have â¥5% Variant Allele Fraction (VAF); (c) more than four reads must support the variant; (d) the average relative distance of the variant from the start/end of reads must be greater than 0.1; (e) the difference in mismatch quality sum between variant and reference reads must be less than 50; (f) the difference in mapping quality between variant and reference reads must be less than 30; (g) the difference in average supporting read length between variant and reference reads must be less than 25; (h) the average relative distance to the effective 3â end of variant supporting reads must be at least 0.2; and (i) the variant must not be adjacent to five or more bases of the same nucleotide identity (for example, a homopolymer run of the same base). (2) VarScan Somatic version 2.2.6 [33, 34] was run with default parameters and the variant calls were filtered by GMS filter âvarscan-high-confidence filter version v1â. The âvarscan-high-confidence v1â filter employed the following rules to filter out variants: (a) P value (reported by Varscan) is greater than 0.07; (b) Normal VAF is greater than 5%; (c) Tumor VAF is less than 10%; or (d) less than two reads support the variant. The remaining variant calls were then processed through false-positive filter v1 (params: --bam-readcount-version 0.4 --bamreadcount-min-base-quality 15) as described above. (3) Strelka version 1.0.10 [35] (params: isSkipDepthFiltersâ=â1)., Our GMS pipeline expects a matched normal sample for filtering out potentially rare germline variants. However, in the absence of a matched normal tissue, the dbSNP and 1000 Genome databases could be used for filtering these variants., The consolidated list of somatic mutations identified from these different variant-callers was then annotated using our internal annotator as part of the GMS pipeline. This annotator leverages the functionality of the Ensembl database [36] and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) [37]., We wish to emphasize that any properly formatted list of annotated variants can be used as input to subsequent steps in the pipeline. From the annotated variants, there are two critical components that are needed for pVAC-Seq: amino acid change and transcript sequence. Even a single amino acid change in the transcript arising from missense mutations can alter the binding affinity of the resulting peptide with the HLA class I molecule and/or recognition by the T cell receptor. Larger insertions and deletions like those arising from frameshift and truncating mutations, splicing aberrations, gene fusions, and so on may also result in potential neoantigens. However, for this initial version of pVAC-Seq, we chose to focus our analysis on only missense mutations., One of the key features of our pipeline is the ability to compare the differences between the tumor and the normal peptides in terms of the peptide binding affinity. Additionally, it leverages RNA-Seq data to incorporate isoform-level expression information and to quickly cull variants that are not expressed in the tumor. To easily integrate RNA-Seq data, both transcript ID as well as the entire WT transcript amino acid sequence is needed as part of the annotated variant file., One of the key components of pVAC-Seq is predicting epitopes that result from mutations by calculating their binding affinity against the HLA class I molecule. This process involves the following steps for effectively preparing the input data as well as parsing the output (Fig. 2).
                      Fig. 2
                        Generation of peptide sequences and filtering predicted epitope candidates. a Amino acid FASTA sequence is built using 10 flanking amino acids on each side of the mutated amino acid. The preceding or succeeding 20 amino acids are taken if the mutation lies near the end or beginning of the transcript, respectively. b All predicted candidate peptides from epitope prediction software based on selected k-mer window size. c Only localized peptides (those containing the mutant amino acid) are considered to compare to WT counterpart. d The âbest candidateâ (lowest MT binding score) per mutation is chosen across all specified k-mers and between all independent HLA allele types that were used as input
                      , Peptide sequences are a key input to the MHC binding prediction tool, and the existing process to efficiently compare the germline normal with the tumor is very onerous. To streamline the comparison, we first build a FASTA file that consists of two amino acid sequences per variant site: WT (normal) and mutant (tumor). The FASTA sequence is built using approximately eight to 10 flanking amino acids on each side of the mutated amino acid. However, if the mutation is towards the end or beginning of the transcript, then the preceding or succeeding 16 to 20 amino acids are taken, respectively, as needed, to build the FASTA sequence. Subsequently, a key file is created with the header (name and type of variant) and order of each FASTA sequence in the file. This is done to correlate the output with the name of the variant protein, as subsequent epitope prediction software strips off each FASTA header., Previous studies [38, 39] have shown that allele-specific epitope prediction software, such as NetMHC, perform slightly better when compared to pan-specific methods such as NetMHCpan [40â42] in case of well-characterized alleles due to availability of large amounts of training data. However, pan-specific methods could be beneficial in cases where there is limited peptide binding data for training, for arbitrary HLA molecules, or when predicting epitopes for non-human species. We do anticipate adding this support for additional softwares in upcoming versions of pVAC-Seq. To predict high affinity peptides that bind to the HLA class I molecule, currently only the standalone version of NetMHC v3.4 is supported. The input to this software is the HLA class I haplotype of the patient, determined via genotyping or using in silico methods, as well as the FASTA file generated in the previous step comprising mutated and WT 17-21-mer sequences. Typically, antigenic epitopes presented by HLA class I molecules can vary in length and are in the range of eight to 11 amino acids (aa). Hence, we recommend specifying the same range when running epitope prediction software., Starting with the output list of all possible epitopes from the epitope prediction software, we apply specific filters to choose the best candidate mutant peptides. First, we restrict further consideration to strong- to intermediate-binding peptides by focusing on candidates with a mutant (MT) binding score of less than 500 nM. Second, epitope binding calls are evaluated only for those peptides that contain the mutant amino acid (localized peptides). This filter eliminates any WT peptides that may overlap between the two FASTA sequences. Our workflow enables screening across multiple lengths and multiple alleles very efficiently. If predictions are run to assess multiple epitope lengths (for example, 9-mer, 10-mer, and so on), and/or to evaluate all patientâs HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles, we review all localized peptides and choose the single best binding value representative across lengths (9 aa, 10 aa, and so on) based on lowest binding score for MT sequence. Furthermore, we choose the âbest candidateâ (lowest MT binding score) per mutation between all independent HLA alleles that were used as input. Additionally, in the output file, the WT peptide binding score is provided. Although this score may not directly affect candidate choice or immunogenicity, end users may find this comparative information useful., We subsequently apply several filters to ensure we are predicting neoantigens that are expressed as RNA variants, and that have been predicted correctly based on coverage depth in the normal and tumor tissue datasets. We have found that gene expression levels from RNA-Seq data, measured as fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped (FPKM), provide a good method to filter only the expressed transcripts. We used the tuxedo suite - Tophat [43, 44] and Cufflinks [45] - as part of the GMS to align RNA-Seq data and subsequently infer gene expression for our in-house sequencing data. Depending on the type of RNA prep kit, OvationÂ® RNA-Seq System V2 (NuGEN Technologies, Inc., San Carlos, CA, USA) or TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) used, Tophat was run with the following parameters: Tophat v2.0.8 â--bowtie-versionâ=â2.1.0â for Ovation, and â--library-type fr-firststrand --bowtie-versionâ=â2.1.0â for Truseq. For Ovation data, prior to alignment, paired 2âÃâ100bp sequence reads were trimmed with Flexbar version 2.21 [46] (params: --adapter CTTTGTGTTTGA --adapter-trim-end LEFT --nono-length-dist --threads 4 --adapter-min-overlap 7 --maxuncalled 150 --min-readlength 25) to remove single primer isothermal amplification adapter sequences. Expression levels (FPKM) were calculated with Cufflinks v2.0.2 (params: --max-bundle-lengthâ=â10000000 --num-threads 4)., For selecting unique vaccine candidates, targeting the best âqualityâ mutations is an important factor for prioritizing peptides. Sequencing depth as well as the fraction of reads containing the variant allele (VAF) are used as criteria to filter or prioritize mutations. This information was added in our pipeline via bam-readcount [47]. Both tumor (from DNA as well as RNA) and normal coverage are calculated along with the VAF from corresponding DNA and RNA-Seq alignments., Since manufacturing antigenic peptides is one of the most expensive steps in vaccine development and efficacy depends on selection of the best neoantigens, we filter the list of predicted high binding peptides to the most highly confident set, primarily with expression and coverage based filters. The pVAC-Seq pipeline permits user-specified filters, and we encourage new users to experiment with these cutoffs in order to tailor the pipeline to their input data and analysis needs. We employ the following filters: (a) Depth based filters: We filter out any variants with normal coverageâ<=5Ã and normal VAF ofâ>=2%. The normal coverage cutoff can be increased up to 20Ã to eliminate occasional misclassification of germline variants as somatic. Similarly, the normal VAF cutoff can be increased based on suspected level of contamination by tumor cells in the normal sample., For tumor coverage from DNA and/or RNA, a cutoff is placed atâ>=10Ã with a VAF ofâ>=40%. This ensures that neoantigens from the founder clone in the tumor are included, but the tumor VAF can be lowered to capture more variants, which are less likely to be present in all tumor cells. Alternatively, if the patients are selected based on a pre-existing disease-associated mutation such as BRAF V600E in the case of melanoma, the VAF of the specific presumed driver mutation can be used as a guide for assessing clonality of other mutations. Also, other known driver mutations such as KRAS G12/G13 or NRAS Q61 may be used to determine purity, and to subsequently adjust the VAF filters to target founder clone mutations. (b) Expression based filters: As a standard, genes with FPKM values greater than zero are considered to be expressed. We slightly increase this threshold to 1, to eliminate noise. Alternatively, we analyze the FPKM distribution (and the corresponding standard deviation) over the entire sample, to determine the sample-specific cutoffs for gene expression. Spike-in controls may also be added to the RNA-Seq experiment to assess quality of the sequencing library and to normalize gene expression data. Since alternative splicing can give rise to multiple transcripts that encompass the variant residue, optionally, all these transcripts could be included in analysis during the annotation step. However, one should be careful as this could potentially give rise to transcripts that do not include the variant. Also, long transcripts or transcripts with high G/C content might show some bias if RNA-CapSeq is used but in our experience are generally well represented. The primary goal of using RNA-(Cap)Seq data in our method is to address to questions of primary importance: (1) is the gene expressed at a reasonably high level (for example, FPKM >1); and (2) is the variant allele expressed in the RNA-seq fragment population., This filtered list of mutations is manually reviewed via visual inspection of aligned reads in a genome viewer like IGV [48, 49] to reduce the retention of obvious false positive mutations., To demonstrate the workings of our in silico pVAC-Seq pipeline, we applied it to four metastatic melanoma patients, the clinical results for three of whom were described previously [20]. In brief, there were three patients (MEL21, MEL38, MEL218) with stage III resected cutaneous melanoma, all of whom had received prior treatment with ipilimumab, and one patient (MEL69) with stage IV cutaneous melanoma. All four patients were enrolled in a phase 1 vaccine clinical trial (NCT00683670, BB-IND 13590) employing autologous, functionally mature, interleukin (IL)-12p70-producing dendritic cells (DC). Informed consent for genome sequencing and data sharing was obtained for all patients on a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of Washington University. We performed genomic analysis of their surgically excised tumors to select candidates for the personalized DC vaccine. Three of these patients (MEL21, MEL38, MEL69) had multiple metachronous tumors. Exome sequencing as well as RNA-CapSeq was performed for each of these tumors, and their corresponding matched normal tissue. The raw exome and transcriptome sequence data are available on the Sequence Read Archive database: Bioproject PRJNA278450, and corresponding dbGaP accession: phs001005., Since melanoma patients harbor hundreds of mutations, it can be challenging to filter down and target the best set of potentially immunogenic neoantigens for vaccine design. For each of the four metastatic melanoma patients, we used the annotated list of SNVs generated using the GMS strategy described above, and analyzed them via our pVAC-Seq pipeline. As mentioned earlier, for the demonstration of this workflow, amino acid changes resulting from only missense mutations were considered for analysis. Table 1 shows the breakdown of these SNVs described previously [20] and the data generated in subsequent steps through our workflow, leading to a high-confidence list of neoepitopes. As part of our local workflow, NetMHC v3.4 was used as the epitope prediction software to generate HLA class I restricted epitopes.Table 1

                    The table illustrates the number of raw candidates predicted by NetMHC, and the parsing and filtering strategies applied thereafter to the final list of neoantigen candidates. These candidates were then communicated to our vaccine design collaborators who evaluated this list by patient-specific immunological assays (Filters 3 & 4) [20]
                  , As is evident from Table 1, there were multitudes of epitopes reported by NetMHC v3.4 in its raw format. This number increased even further with the addition of each HLA class I allele. Using pVAC-Seq, and its recommended thresholds for filtering (binding and coverage-based), we were able to produce a more reasonable list of high affinity HLA class I binding neoantigen candidates for experimental validation., These candidate neoantigens were experimentally tested in binding assays and those with confirmed binding to HLA class I restricting molecules were incorporated in the vaccine formulation [20]. Since all of these patients harbor the BRAF V600E mutation, we used its VAF in each sample as a comparative control of tumor purity and clonality. Integration of variant coverage information from Exome and RNA-Seq (VAF), as well as mutant expression information (FPKM), provided additional information needed to make an informed decision on the number and identity of peptides to include in each patient-specific vaccine (Fig. 3, Additional file 2: Figure S2, Additional file 3: Figure S3, and Additional file 4: Figure S4).
                    Fig. 3
                      Landscape of filtered neoantigen candidates. This figure illustrates the landscape of neoantigen vaccine candidates in patient MEL21 after being prioritized using the pVAC-Seq pipeline. The points represent the overall sequencing information: exome and RNA VAFs, gene expression in terms of log2 FPKM value, as well log2 fold change, calculated as the ratio of WT binding affinity over mutant binding affinity. Recommended exome and RNA VAF cutoffs are also indicated. Candidates that were incorporated in the vaccine are labeled based on the genes containing these somatic mutations. Red boxes depict naturally occurring (that is, pre-existing T cell response) and blue boxes denote vaccine-induced neoantigens that were recognized by T cells. Since BRAF was used as a guide for assessing clonality of other mutations, it is also shown in each of three metachronous tumors (from the same patient)
                    , As shown, if existing epitope prediction software tools were solely used to generate neoantigen predictions in these patients, it would have been challenging to integrate the filters as well as the important digital sequencing metrics that ultimately determined the âqualityâ of these candidates. By implementing the novel methods reported in this manuscript, we were able to rapidly streamline the screening and identification of a smaller number of potentially immunogenic neoepitopes within the landscape of all neoepitopes. This method can be further extended to include other genomic alterations such as frame-shift insertions and deletions, splicing aberrations, and gene fusions, which may in some cases cause larger changes in epitope binding affinities. We are currently testing approaches to include binding predictions from frame-shift insertions and deletions by incorporating VEP annotation, and once tested, will be adding this functionality to the github repository for pVAC-Seq. By expanding the focus from just somatic point mutations to the entire neoantigen landscape, it may also be possible to better assess whether neoantigen load itself can serve as a biomarker for prediction of checkpoint blockade response., The current regimen for predicting and screening neoantigens from sequencing data is laborious and involves a large number of intermediate steps such as creating FASTA files, running the prediction algorithms (most of the time online), and filtering output for high binding affinity candidates. Our flexible, automated in silico workflow, pVAC-Seq, provides higher efficiency and faster turnaround by automating many of these steps. This approach should help to evaluate tumor-specific neoepitopes in a much-reduced time, thereby increasing its applicability for clinical use. As we learn from ongoing early mouse and human trials, the methods developed will help optimize the composition of personalized cancer vaccines with high precision and will expedite vaccine design to address growing clinical demand.,

                Background
                Frailty is arguably the biggest problem associated with population ageing, and associates with gut microbiome composition in elderly and care-dependent individuals. Here we characterize frailty associations with the gut microbiota in a younger community dwelling population, to identify targets for intervention to encourage healthy ageing.
              
                Method
                We analysed 16S rRNA gene sequence data derived from faecal samples obtained from 728 female twins. Frailty was quantified using a frailty index (FI). Mixed effects models were used to identify associations with diversity, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and taxa. OTU associations were replicated in the Eldermet cohort. Phenotypes were correlated with modules of OTUs collapsed by co-occurrence.
              
                Results
                Frailty negatively associated with alpha diversity of the gut microbiota. Models considering a number of covariates identified 637 OTUs associated with FI. Twenty-two OTU associations were significant independent of alpha diversity. Species more abundant with frailty included Eubacterium dolichum and Eggerthella lenta. A Faecalibacterium prausnitzii OTU was less abundant in frailer individuals, and retained significance in discordant twin analysis. Sixty OTU associations were replicated in the Eldermet cohort. OTU co-occurrence modules had mutually exclusive associations between frailty and alpha diversity.
              
                Conclusions
                There was a striking negative association between frailty and gut microbiota diversity, underpinned by specific taxonomic associations. Whether these relationships are causal or consequential is unknown. Nevertheless, they represent targets for diagnostic surveillance, or for intervention studies to improve vitality in ageing.

Nevertheless, they represent targets for diagnostic surveillance, or for intervention studies to improve vitality in ageing., The ultimate goal of ageing research should be to increase health-span, mitigating a lifespan burdened by morbidity. To this end, frailty is a useful indicator of overall health deficit, describing a physiological loss of reserve capacity and reduced resistance to stressors [1, 2]. It predicts adverse health states such as hospitalisation, dependency and mortality better than chronological age [3], and is increasingly important given the ageing global population with UN estimates of 1.2 billion people aged over 60 years by 2025 [4]., The gut microbiome is the collective coding capacity of the >100 trillion bacteria which significantly enriches the metabolism of the human âsuperorganismâ [5]. It is highly variable between individuals [6], with substantial heritable elements [7], and relatively stable within a healthy adult over time [8]. Inflammation of the gut is associated with disruption of the gut microbiome [9, 10]. Since the gut is the largest interface with external microbes, and frailty is associated with chronic inflammation [11], it is likely that the gut microbiome has a role in frailty., Age and frailty influence both the composition and function of the gut microbiome in mice [12]. Similarly in humans, significant differences have been observed between the composition of the adult and elderly adult microbiota [13]. When investigating the effects of frailty, significant differences in the abundances of 17 gut microbes were found between 10 highly frail and 13 âlow frailâ individuals aged over 70 years, from the same care home who shared the same diet [14]. In the larger Eldermet study, the faecal microbiota composition and diversity of 178 older adults varied with level of health dependency. Patients in long-stay continuing care had a less diverse microbiota than short stay, or community dwelling older adults. Dietary intake differed significantly by residence location, and appeared to drive microbiota associations [15]. Across the whole cohort, in various residence locations, the main axis of microbiota composition change correlated with frailty. We recently showed that discrete configurations of microbial taxa can be robustly defined, several of which have distinctive associations with long-term care, frailty and inflammation [16]. These analyses have focused on generally older, more dependent, participants., Here we aimed to identify associations between frailty and the gut microbiota within a large cohort of younger community dwelling female twins, adjusting for possible confounding effects such as diet, and genetic and environmental factors shared by twins. We describe significant associations between frailty and microbiota diversity and composition, which represent potential diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets for interventions to reduce frailty in ageing., Frailty was quantified through the Rockwood Frailty Index (FI), which translates meaningfully from an epidemiological perspective to clinical studies [17]. The FI was created as a proportion of deficits [18], using data from the Healthy Ageing Twin Study [19]. Thirty-nine domains of binary health deficit were created from questionnaire data and clinical tests covering a range of aspects of physiological and mental health (Additional file 1: Table S1)., Faecal samples were collected, bacterial DNA extracted, amplified, sequenced and processed as part of a previous study (see methods therein) [7]. Quality filtering and phylogenetic analysis was performed using QIIME 1.7.0 [20]. OTUs were assigned using closed reference clustering with Greengenes v13_5 at 97 % sequence similarity using UCLUST, resulting in the exclusion of 6.2 % of the total sequences that did not cluster to the reference [7]., OTUs that were observed in fewer than 25 % of individuals were not considered for further study. From a total set of 9,840 OTUs (after removing singletons) 16 % passed this threshold, reflective of the sparseness of the data, resulting in a final set of 1,587 OTUs that were used in association analyses. This threshold was applied to focus on associations within abundant OTUs where data sparsity would be less influential on analyses., The lme4 package in R was used to generate linear mixed-effects models [21]. The FI was root normalised. Technical covariates included sequencing run and number of sequences in each sample. Biological covariates included relatedness (measured by twin family and zygosity), habitual diet (quantified as the first five PCs from food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) previously assigned to different dietary niches within TwinsUK) [22], alcohol intake, smoking status, age and BMI. Sequencing run and familial traits were modelled as random effects. The Anova function in R was used to compare the ability of models with and without the variable of interest to predict the appropriate response., Alpha diversity was quantified as observed OTU counts and Shannon and Simpson diversity indices. These were used as response variables to assess associations with alpha diversity., Models were compared with and without frailty for their ability to predict the log transformed relative abundances of OTUs. Zero counts were handled by addition of an arbitrary value (10â6). Modelling was repeated adjusting for alpha diversity to identify associations independent of overall decreases in diversity. The Shannon metric was chosen, as it considers OTU abundance, was not greatly influenced by sequencing depth and was normally distributed. P values were adjusted for multiple testing of OTUs, by false discovery rate (FDR) correction using the âqvalueâ package in R [23]. This was similarly carried out on the relative abundances of collapsed species and genera., Non-parametric analyses of FI and OTU abundance associations were carried out using the Kendallâs rank sum correlation method in R. The root transformed FI was correlated against the residuals of OTU abundance from previously described mixed models excluding FI. The âqvalueâ package was used for FDR correction with significance at 5 %., This was used to demonstrate a lack of bias and potential non-genetic effects. FI discordance between twins was determined where the difference in the pairâs root normalised FI was greater than one standard deviation of the populationâs. Paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare the abundance of OTUs between discordant twins. P values were Bonferonni adjusted with a significance threshold of P <0.05. This was carried out for MZ twins only, DZ twins only and both combined., The R package WGCNA was used to cluster OTUs by co-occurrence [24]. This has been used previously to select OTU modules from pre-calculated co-occurrence matrices [25]. However, in this instance, we also used WGCNA functions to quantify co-occurrence using Pearson correlation between the log transformed relative abundances of OTUs. The pickSoftThreshold function was then used to identify an adjacency threshold (17) above which the edges of the network created a scale-free topology. This adjacency matrix was converted to a signed topological overlap matrix (TOM) using the TOMsimilarity function. Hierarchical clustering of OTUs was performed from a dissimilarity matrix derived from the TOM to generate a dendrogram. Modules were selected using the cuttreeDynamic function to select 24 groups of co-occurring OTUs, containing at least 10 members each. Eigenvectors representing each module were generated using the moduleEigengenes function, to obtain the first PC from the moduleâs OTU abundance matrix. A dendrogram of module dissimilarity was generated from a Pearson correlation matrix between the eigenvectors, and modules found to be at least 80 % similar were merged. This resulted in 22 final modules, for which eigenvectors were recalculated. The WGCNA cor function was used to calculate Pearson correlation coefficients between these eigenvectors and phenotypic traits., OTU-level metadata associations were investigated in data from the Eldermet study [15], considering 280 elderly individuals with a mean age of 78 years (age range, 64â102 years). The dataset included community-dwelling individuals, outpatient day-hospital visitors, and short-term and long-term care dwelling individuals., The Eldermet reference sequences were mapped to the reference sequences from all OTUs, both significant and non-significant, that were assigned to species significantly associated with frailty in TwinsUK. Where there was more than one match between the datasets, the highest scoring BLAST result was retained. Only results above 97 % similarity across the intersect of the sequences were used in subsequent analyses., Mapped OTUs in the Eldermet dataset were tested for significant association to frailty using a DESeq2 statistical model [26], whereby OTUs were said to be significantly differentially abundant between individuals with a Barthel score <10 compared to a Barthel score of 10 or greater in the Eldermet study if their adjusted P value was less than 0.05., Frailty, microbiome and complete covariate data were available for 728 women from the TwinsUK cohort. The mean age of the cohort was 63 years (age range, 42â86 years) [7]. The FI followed the expected gamma distribution (Additional file 2: Figure S2) [18], had a mean of 0.116, with 103 pre-frail individuals (FI >0.20) [27]. Thus, on average, members of this cohort have low frailty indices reflective of their age and community dwelling status., Linear mixed-effects modelling of alpha diversity versus FI adjusting for age, diet, alcohol intake, smoking, BMI and technical covariates, showed frailty had a significant negative association with alpha diversity (Table 1). It was the most influential determinant of alpha diversity for all metrics considered except observed OTU count, which was influenced by the number of sequences (more deeply sampled sequences having more low abundance OTUs).Table 1

                      Mixed effects models were created with Shannon index, Simpson index or number of observed OTUs as the response. ANOVA was used to compare models with and without each variable. Comparisons where P <0.05 are highlighted
                    , Models were extended to investigate frailty effects on OTU abundances. Significant associations were found with 637 OTUs using FDR 5 % (Additional file 3: Table S3). Negative associations were enriched for Clostridiales, in particular Ruminococcaceae, with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii the most abundant species level assignment (21 OTUs, all negatively associated). Positively associated OTUs that could be assigned at the species level included Eubacterium dolichum and Eggerthella lenta., Modelling was repeated also including Shannon diversity as a covariate. This was carried out to identify frailty specific associations that did not result from the overall decrease in alpha diversity; for instance, cases where a microbeâs abundance is reduced due to reduced abundance of cooperative taxa rather than frailty effects directly. After adjustment for alpha diversity, 22 OTUs remained significant at FDR 5 % (Additional file 3: Table S3). Nineteen belonged to the order Clostridiales; 11 of which were assigned to the family Lachnospiraceae and eight to Ruminococcaceae, although the direction of association was not consistent at the family level. Two OTUs were assigned to the order Erysipelotrichales and one to Coriobacteriales. Three OTUs were assigned species-level taxonomy corresponding to F. prausnitzii (FDR q = 0.027 Beta = â0.14), E. dolichum (FDR q = 0.013 Beta = 0.17) and E. lenta (FDR q = 0.048 Beta = 0.13)., The FI was constructed from measurements taken 0â3 years before faecal sampling. We would expect a monotonic increase in frailty with age [18], so differences in the time between FI quantification and sample collection between individuals should not significantly influence results and only serve to reduce associations. However, to ensure time passage had no effect, OTU level modelling was repeated including the time difference between the faecal and FI measurements as a covariate. All previously identified OTUs retained significance, with the number of significant OTUs increasing slightly to 672., To account for genetics and environmental influences within twins, the difference in abundance of the 22 OTUs significant after alpha diversity adjustment was examined between 111 pairs (65 DZ and 46 MZ) discordant for frailty. Three OTUs showed significantly differential abundance (Fig. 1). An OTU assigned to the genus Dorea was the only OTU more abundant in frailer twins (P = 4 Ã 10â3). Two OTUs were less abundant in the frailer individuals, which were the F.prausnitzii OTU (P = 0.03) and one assigned to the family Lachnospiraceae (P = 4 Ã 10â3). No OTUs were significantly different considering the discordant MZ subset only and the Dorea OTU was the only OTU significant within DZ pairs alone. In cases where an OTU was not detected in one twin within a pair, absence generally followed the expected direction from previously observed associations.
                      Fig. 1
                        OTU abundances significantly different between twin pairs discordant for frailty. Pairwise plots of abundance between twin pairs discordant for frailty are shown for OTUs that were significant at P <0.05 after Bonferonni adjustment considering both MZ and DZ pairs. Paired Wilcoxon rank-signed tests were used to compare abundances for the 22 significantly associated OTUs associated with FI after alpha adjustment. Three were significantly different; the Dorea OTU was significantly increased in frailer twins (P <10â4), whilst the F. prausnitzii and Lachnospiraceae OTUs were significantly lower (P = 0.001 and P <10â3, respectively). Note there are overlapping data points where multiple twins had zero counts (log abundance â6) for OTUs
                      , OTU counts were collapsed by shared taxonomic assignment at the species, genus and family level. The abundances of taxonomic groups were modelled with frailty as a predictor (Additional file 4: Table S4). Twelve species traits were significantly associated with frailty at FDR 5 %. The three most significant were F. prausnitzii, E. dolichum and E. lenta. Other collapsed species were largely from the order Clostridiales and negatively associated with FI. E. dolichum and E. lenta positively associated with frailty. Only E. dolichum remained significant after adjustment for alpha diversity., Twelve genera were FDR significant without alpha adjustment. Ten were negatively associated with FI, seven belonging to the order Clostridiales. The only genera positively associated with FI were Coprobacillus and Eggerthella, the latter the only genus significant after alpha adjustment. The direction of association with frailty of collapsed species and genera containing F. prausnitzii, and E. lenta reflected those of their constituent OTUs, whereas the Eubacterium genus was not significantly associated with FI (Fig. 2). Two collapsed families were significantly associated with FI at FDR 5 %; both belonged to the class Mollicutes but were non-significant after alpha adjustment.
                      Fig. 2
                        Species abundance associates with FI. Shown are the unadjusted relative abundances versus FI for all species traits that were significantly associated with FI in mixed effects models, and had complete species name assignment. Below, similar plots for their parent genera. *Represents taxa whose association remained FDR significant after adjustment for alpha diversity. Q-values and coefficients shown are without alpha adjustment. Trends are highlighted by linear regression lines shown in red with 95 % confidence intervals shaded in grey. OTUs contained within these taxonomies retained significance within non-parametric analyses
                      , A number of species were not detectable (classified as absent) within the extremes of frailty, for example, E. dolichum and E. lenta within less frail individuals. We carried out non-parametric analyses to ensure this effect was not inflating significance in mixed models. This was carried out at the OTU level where absence is most prevalent. Associations between OTU abundance and FI were reassessed using Kendallâs rank sum correlations (Additional file 5: Table S5). A total of 138 OTUs were significant at FDR 5 %. All were found in the 637 OTUs identified without alpha adjustment, except seven newly identified OTUs that were all assigned to the family Ruminococcaceae. They also contained 16 of the 22 OTUs significant after alpha adjustment, including the F. prausnitzii, E. dolichum and E. lenta OTUs. This shows that using non-parametric methods, where absence is less influential, the top hits remained significant., We sought to replicate associations using data from the Eldermet cohort [15, 16], a study that used different methods for sequencing and taxonomic assignment and quantified frailty differently using the Barthel index. Eldermet is also a frailer, more elderly and more dependent cohort, including men and women., To maximise overlap, OTUs were selected within TwinsUK at the species level. That is, all OTUs that were assigned to species that were significantly associated with FI within TwinsUK were considered for replication regardless of the OTUâs association. Representative sequences from these OTUs within TwinsUK were matched to representatives of OTUs in the Eldermet dataset. Of 638 TwinsUK OTUs considered, 435 mapped to 191 OTUs in the Eldermet cohort. A number of OTUs mapped to the same OTU in the Eldermet set and the remaining 203 had less than the required 97 % similarity to the Eldermet representative sequences and could not be mapped., Of these 191 mappable OTUs, 96 were significant FI-associated OTUs in TwinsUK. Within the Eldermet cohort, 61 of the 96 were significantly differentially abundant between individuals with a Barthel score of less than 10 compared to a Barthel score of 10 or greater (adjusted P value <0.05) as defined the by DEseq statistical methodology. The association to frailty was consistent for all but one of these results., Within the 60 OTUs that replicated across the two studies, 55 were negatively associated with FI and five positively associated with FI. Of the negatively associated, 54 of the 55 were Clostridia/Clostridiales with the final OTU being Mollicutes/RF39., The five positive associations were E. dolichum, E. lenta, two Ruminococcaceae and another Clostridia/Clostridiales. This is consistent with observations in the previously published Eldermet studies that showed populations of co-abundant OTUs that contain a large number of unclassified Clostridiales being both positively and negatively associated with frailty and biological ageing [16]., Of the TwinsUK significant variables that failed to reach significance in the Eldermet cohort, 23 of the 35 had an association to frailty that was consistent in direction between the two studies., TwinsUK OTUs that belonged to significant species but were non-significantly associated at the OTU level, mapped to 95 OTUs in the Eldermet cohort. Of these, 38 had a significant association to frailty in the Eldermet cohort but the association to frailty was inconsistent, with 11 of the 38 showing the opposite association. This shows that the non-significant TwinsUK OTUs have an inconsistent association in the two datasets and so species level associations are poor markers of frailty., These results highlight the advantage of carefully identifying a set of high quality predictors of frailty using the twin cohort. The significant OTUs returned were consistent in the direction of the association with frailty with the Eldermet observational study., Bacteria that share functionality or which are inter-dependent may be taxonomically unrelated but associate similarly with frailty. To overcome this, we collapsed OTUs by co-occurrence, producing 22 co-occurrence modules that were labelled using colour names (the module âgreyâ contained unallocated OTUs) (Additional file 6: Table S6). Each module represented groups of OTUs with similar abundance profiles across samples, often with similar taxonomic backgrounds. For example, the module coloured brown in Fig. 3 contained 59 Clostridiales OTUs; these included 14 assigned to F. prausnitzii which, upon inspection of the representative sequences, were found to share greater than 97 % sequence similarity, highlighting the limitations of OTU clustering and the ability of co-occurrence collapsing to identify similar features.
                      Fig. 3
                        Correlation of frailty, diversity and model covariates with modules of OTUs collapsed by co-occurrence. OTUs collapsed by co-occurrence into 21 modules labelled by colour (grey containing unassigned OTUs). The heatmap displays the correlation between the module eigenvector (ME, representing the combined module abundance as taken from the first PC of the moduleâs OTUs across all samples) and each variable. Modules and variables are hierarchically clustered using Euclidean distances. Student asymptotic P values for significant correlations (P <0.05) are shown. The most common taxonomic assignment within a module is shown next to its colour label
                      , Eigenvectors representing each module were used to correlate sample traits with module abundance (Fig. 3). Modules showed the strongest associations with FI and alpha diversity, which contrasted in all cases. Modules significantly negatively associated with FI included those coded magenta, royal blue, salmon, midnight blue and tan (Fig. 3); all consisting of OTUs assigned to Lachnospiraceae, in particular that coded royal blue to the genus Dorea and tan to the genus Roseburia. Other modules negatively associating with FI were black, blue, light cyan, brown, green, purple and green-yellow. All were assigned to Clostridiales OTUs, particularly Ruminococcaceae with brown and green consisting of largely F. prausnitzii OTUs. The only module positively associating with frailty was that coded light yellow, containing 13 Enterobacteriaceae OTUs. Clustering traits by their association with modules separated alpha diversity from the other variables. These formed two clusters of differential association, one containing frailty and the other with correlation patterns more similar to those of diversity. BMI, the low meat FFQ PC and the traditional English FFQ PC all clustered with FI. The alpha diversity like cluster contained the remaining dietary PCs, alcohol consumption and age., Robust associations were identified between frailty and gut microbiota composition. Most notably, FI associated with microbiota diversity. There were also modest associations, both positive and negative, with specific taxa. These findings were robust to adjustment for a range of environmental variables and, in what we believe to be a novel analysis, adjustment for alpha diversity. A number of OTU-metadata associations replicated within the Eldermet cohort., The distinct negative association between alpha diversity and frailty reflects observations from numerous studies in which predisposition to ill health associates reduced diversity [28â31]. In this study we cannot determine if frailty is the cause, or a consequence of lower microbiota diversity. However, the observed changes in the microbiome could contribute, at least in part, to the detrimental health associated with frailty, particularly in the gut. Should this be the case, maintenance or improvement of gut diversity would be a promising target to encourage health in ageing. This could be achieved through lifestyle interventions to alter factors known to influence diversity, such as diet [32, 33]. This might be particularly effective given the similarity of the observed microbiome associations with diet, BMI and frailty., We also observed specific taxonomic associations with frailty in the gut microbiota. These were most apparent at the OTU level where a number of significant associations were also observed within the Eldermet cohort, which utilised differing sequencing and analysis platforms, quantified frailty using an alternate index, and used a frailer population [15]. The robustness of our results is supported by their replication within this contrasting data. However, although they were significant, OTU associations were had modest effect sizes. Further studies will be required to investigate the importance of specific taxa in frailty. Our observations provide motivation and direction for such, and are discussed further below., A number of F. prausnitzii OTUs negatively associated with frailty, reflecting previous observations of reduced F. prausnitzii abundance in frail or elderly individuals [14, 34]. F. prausnitzii is a key butyrate producer [35, 36], thriving in low pH environments created by other short-chain fatty acid producers [37]. There is evidence that F. prausnitzii (and butyrate [38]) can have an anti-inflammatory effect on the gut in mice [39, 40]. The observed negative associations of FI with a sub-set of Lachnospiraceae OTUs also support the role of butyrate producers in suppressing frailty-associated inflammation. Some, but not all, Lachnospiraceae genera are butyrate producers [41]; including Roseburia, which we identified as negatively correlated with FI when collapsing OTUs by co-occurrence. These observations warrant further investigation into the effects of gut butyrate production on the progression of frailty., 
                        E. dolichum and E. lenta positively associated with frailty in our experiment. The Eggerthella genus contains a number of pathogenic species, including E. lenta, that have been associated with gastrointestinal disease [42â44]. E. lenta is also known to harbour a cardiac glycoside reductase operon, which can reduce digoxin, to its more inactive reduced lactone dihydrodigoxin [45].  This drug has been commonly used in frail older individuals to control ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation.  Our finding should stimulate further research as to whether the efficacy and toxicity of cardiac glycosides may be modulated by E. lenta abundance., Turnbaugh and colleagues sequenced the E. dolichum genome after observing that its parent class, Mollicutes, was associated with obesity in mice [46]. Its genome was enriched for genes involved in simple sugar processing, which was hypothesised to provide an advantage under a Western diet. The increased abundance of E. dolichum are likely a consequence of the significant lifestyle changes, particularly dietary, associated with frailty [15]. However, it is possible that changes to microbiome-encoded metabolism are drivers of frailty. Further studies are warranted to distinguish associations with frailty from those with diet and obesity. Longitudinal observational studies would be of particular use to identify the capacity of specific species to predict an individualâs trajectory of frailty., While the observed microbiome associations with frailty were robust to discordant twin analyses and replication in an independent cohort, as a cross-sectional study they are not suggestive of cause. To address this, longitudinal frailty and microbial assessments are planned within the TwinsUK cohort. This study was also limited by the determination of the gut microbiota composition using 16S rRNA amplicon analysis, and would be improved through the use of whole metagenome sequencing which provides more accurate species level assignments and direct functional information [5]., This study focused on abundant OTUs to reduce the influence of data sparsity on the analyses. However, by using a closed OTU clustering approach and discarding less abundant OTUs we have not explored the association of rare and unidentified microbiota with frailty. This may be important in future investigations as there may be novel bacterial units specific to the frail state., We have also not considered the effects of antibiotics and other medication usage on the microbiome, as there was insufficient data available. These effects could potentially confound the observed associations as frailer individuals are more likely to utilize more, and multiple, medications and factors such as antibiotics are known to influence the gut microbiome [47]. This is also being considered in future studies., The TwinsUK cohort are younger and more able when compared to previously studied cohorts, so these early associations in theory may not apply to frailer individuals. However, replication in the Eldermet cohort, where antibiotic users were excluded, indicates that in part these findings are not restricted to the less frail individuals within TwinsUK. Use of alternate methods in the quantification of the microbiota and frailty within the replication cohort also suggests that observed associations are independent and robust to the methods used., We have identified a number of associations between host frailty and the gut microbiota, including modest associations with specific taxonomic abundances and a striking negative association with microbiota diversity. Although more work is required to delineate the direction of effect between frailty and the composition of the gut microbiota, we believe that the associations we have described here provide motivation and direction for such studies. They also provide microbial targets for future investigation, with the ultimate goal to develop the capability to rationally modulate the gut microbiome to improve health in ageing people., Ethical approval for the HATS (Healthy Ageing Twin Study), from which the frailty data were obtained, and microbiota studies within TwinsUK were provided by the NRES Committee London â Westminster. The Cork Clinical Research Ethics Committee provided approval for the Eldermet study., Sequence data for samples within this study are available as part of previously published data under the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) accession numbers ERP006339 and ERP006342 [7]. Other data are available for request from TwinsUK.,

Infection-associated cancers (Table 1) include hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) induced by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [3â5]; lymphomas, nasopharyngeal cancers (NPCs), and gastric cancers associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [6, 7]; cervical and head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCCs) induced by human papillomavirus (HPV) [8, 9]; Merkel cell carcinoma associated with Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) [10, 11]; and gastric cancers induced by Helicobacter pylori [12]. The carcinogenic mechanisms of these infection-associated cancers have been extensively investigated, focusing on the effects of viral and bacterial infections and the resultant inflammation on cell proliferation, cell signaling, and genetic alterations [1].Table 1

                  , In addition to these effects, induction of epigenetic alterations is now regarded as one of the most important mechanisms mediating the effect of viral or bacterial infections on cancer development. The first reports of an association between viral infections and DNA methylation date back to the 1970s; these reports demonstrated an increase in global 5-methylcytosine in cells transformed by adenovirus and polyomavirus [13, 14]. In the 2000s, aberrant DNA methylation of tumor-suppressor genes was detected first in EBV-infection-associated cancers [15] and then in gastric mucosae of individuals with H. pylori infection [16, 17]. To date, many studies have demonstrated a relationship between viral or bacterial infections and aberrant DNA methylation [18â20]., Chronologically, aberrant DNA methylation can already have accumulated in non-cancerous or precancerous tissues, producing an âepigenetic field defectâ or âepigenetic field for cancerizationâ [21]. The epigenetic field for cancerization is characterized by accumulation of aberrant methylation of various genes in a tissue without clonal lesions, and by the correlation between the âseverityâ of a field and cancer risk [21]. The clinical relevance of this concept has recently been demonstrated by a multicenter prospective cohort study to predict risk of metachronous gastric cancer [22]., Mechanistically, aberrant DNA methylation can be induced directly by a component(s) of an infectious agent, as recently shown for EBV [19, 23, 24]. Alternatively and more commonly, aberrant DNA methylation can be induced by chronic inflammation, as robustly shown for H. pylori and hepatitis viruses [25, 26]. In addition, a recent study suggested that chronic inflammation could induce histone modification changes more frequently and much earlier than aberrant DNA methylation, and that some of the aberrant histone modifications can serve as a signal for aberrant DNA methylation [27]., In this review, we first summarize the effect of H. pylori infection, whose role in induction of aberrant DNA methylation and gastric carcinogenesis has been intensively studied, and introduce the mechanisms of how H. pylori infection induces aberrant DNA methylation. Then, we introduce several viral infections that induce aberrant epigenetic alterations, especially DNA methylation, and discuss the mechanisms involved. Finally, we discuss the applications of infection-induced epigenetic alterations for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy., The vast majority of gastric cancer cases worldwide are induced by H. pylori infection. It is an archetypal cancer in which chronic inflammation and epigenetic alterations are interconnected. The mechanisms by which H. pylori infection induces aberrant DNA methylation have been investigated in gastric cancers, cell lines, and animal models [25, 28]. The epigenetic nature of gastric cancer was recently reported [29]., Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, especially in Asia and some European countries [30]. The major risk factor is persistent H. pylori infection [31]; risk is elevated 2.2- to 21-fold by H. pylori infection [12, 32, 33]. In some Asian countries, nearly all gastric cancer patients have a history of H. pylori infection [2]. H. pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium [34, 35] and is thought to be transmitted orally within families during early childhood owing to poor hygiene. Few bacteria can survive in the stomach because of its low pH maintained by the production of gastric acids; however, H. pylori can survive for decades because of its production of urease, which neutralizes its immediate environment [36]. It induces chronic gastritis characterized by persistent infiltration of neutrophils and mononuclear cells, and gastric atrophy [37]. Gastric atrophy is also a strong risk factor for gastric cancer (hazard ratioâ=â14.09 (95 % confidence interval (CI)â=â7.03â28.26)) [38]., Deep involvement of aberrant DNA methylation in human gastric cancers had been suggested by the fact that tumor-suppressor genes, such as CDH1, p16, and hMLH1, were inactivated more frequently by aberrant DNA methylation of their promoter CpG islands than by genetic alterations [39]. More recently, integrated analysis of DNA methylation and genetic alterations in gastric cancer has revealed that genes involved in cancer-related pathways were more frequently affected by DNA methylation than by genetic alterations [29, 40]. Furthermore, recent exome and whole-genome analyses of gastric cancers have revealed new mutated driver genes, such as ARID1A, FAT4, and RHOA, but the incidences of mutations were 14 %, at the most, among the cancers analyzed [41, 42]. Importantly, a significant number of cancers have few mutations; according to a report by Wang et al. [41], 5 of 100 cancers had no mutations, and 22 cancers had only one mutation. These reports support the major role of DNA methylation in gastric cancer., The link between H. pylori infection and DNA methylation in gastric mucosae was first discussed in two contradictory reports in 2003. Chan et al. [43] demonstrated that promoter methylation of the tumor-suppressor gene CDH1 was more frequent in the gastric mucosae of individuals with H. pylori infection than in uninfected individuals. In contrast, Kang et al. [16] did not detect a difference in the number of methylated genes between the gastric mucosae of individuals with and without H. pylori infection. A quantitative DNA methylation analysis of passenger genes (defined as those that do not have a causal role in carcinogenesis) [17] later convincingly demonstrated that H. pylori infection was associated with increased DNA methylation levels in gastric mucosae. These findings highlight the importance of accurate quantification of DNA methylation and analysis of appropriate genes., The increased DNA methylation levels in non-cancerous gastric mucosae with H. pylori infection were observed in various but specific genes, including a small number of tumor-suppressor genes, such as p16, ANGPTL4, and FHL1, and a large number of passenger genes [44â46]. In addition to protein-coding genes, microRNA genes, including miR-124a and miR-34b/c, were also aberrantly methylated in non-cancerous gastric mucosae infected with H. pylori [47, 48]. Importantly, the levels of DNA methylation of various methylated genes were relatively consistent and correlated with the risk of gastric cancer development [17, 49]., To investigate the cell types with aberrant methylation of these genes, normal gastric epithelial cells were purified from an animal model, and the presence of aberrant DNA methylation in these gastric epithelial cells was shown [25]. Three positions within the stomach (antrum, middle body, and upper body) had increased methylation levels in individuals with high risk of gastric cancers compared with corresponding positions in the stomach in individuals with low risk [49]., Therefore, aberrant DNA methylation of various specific genes is accumulated in normal gastric epithelial cells in various positions within the stomach of individuals with high risk of gastric cancers, and an âepigenetic field defectâ or an âepigenetic field for cancerizationâ, which is an area or even an entire tissue predisposed to cancer development, is produced [21]. Generally, the presence of a cancerization field has been known for decades, but it has been explained by mutation accumulation [50]. Now, based on the findings in gastric cancer [21], accumulation of epigenetic alterations in non-cancerous or precancerous tissue has been shown to be important. The concept is likely to be expanded to several types of other infection-associated cancers, and has great value as a risk marker, as discussed later., From the viewpoint of H. pylori infection-induced gastric carcinogenesis, most research has traditionally focused on cell proliferation, induction of genetic instability and mutations, and activation of cellular signaling [51â54]. For example, in the Mongolian gerbil animal model (Meriones unguiculatus), in which H. pylori infection markedly promotes gastric carcinogenesis by a mutagen such as N-methyl-N-nitrosourea [55], chronic inflammation due to H. pylori infection was shown to induce increased cell proliferation, and this may cause further accumulation of mutations [56]. However, induction of aberrant DNA methylation can be even more important as described above., Aberrant DNA methylation can potentially be induced by two mechanisms: directly by a component of H. pylori, such as DNA methyltransferase, being injected into gastric epithelial cells through a bacterial type IV secretion system [57]; or indirectly due to inflammation triggered by H. pylori infection. To clarify which mechanism is important, Niwa et al. [25] used Mongolian gerbils, in which aberrant DNA methylation was induced by H. pylori infection in a manner similar to that observed in humans. They treated gerbils infected with H. pylori with an immunosuppressant, cyclosporine A, and found that the induction of aberrant DNA methylation was strongly suppressed, whereas H. pylori colonization itself was not affected or was even augmented [25]. In addition, one week after H. pylori eradication, when no H. pylori remained in the stomach but inflammation still persisted, aberrant DNA methylation continued to be induced. These data showed that inflammation triggered by H. pylori infection, but not by H. pylori itself, is involved in induction of aberrant DNA methylation (Fig. 1).
                      Fig. 1
                        Mechanisms of induction of aberrant DNA methylation by H. pylori infection. Acute inflammation following infection by H. pylori develops into chronic inflammation characterized by the transition of neutrophil infiltration to that of lymphocytes and macrophages. Chronic inflammation signals, including cytokines such as IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± and/or nitric oxide production, are associated with the induction of aberrant DNA methylation. Aberrant DNA methylation is induced both in driver genes (schematically represented by genes 1 and 2) that are causally involved in gastric cancer development and in passenger genes (genes 3 and 4) that are methylated in association with gastric carcinogenesis in normal-appearing tissues. Driver genes are methylated only at very low levels (shown in blue), showing that such events are present only in a very small fraction of cells, whereas many passenger genes are methylated at high levels (shown in black), showing that their methylation is present in a large fraction of cells. The accumulation of aberrant DNA methylation in normal-appearing tissues produces an âepigenetic field for cancerizationâ, which is an area of tissue or an entire tissue without clonal growth but predisposed to cancer development
                      , The next questions are what types of inflammation are involved in DNA methylation induction and what cytokines or molecules mediate the signal from the inflammation. In gerbils, repeated administration of high concentrations of ethanol or salt (NaCl) induced persistent severe inflammation accompanied by strong induction of cell proliferation, but did not result in induction of aberrant DNA methylation [28]. H. pylori infection induces chronic inflammation, characterized by a transition of inflammatory cell types from polymorphonuclear cells (mainly neutrophils) to mononuclear cells (lymphocytes and macrophages), with some remnant neutrophils [58]. In contrast, prolonged treatment with ethanol or salt induced repeated acute inflammation, characterized by persistent neutrophil infiltration [28]. This indicates that a specific type of inflammation, possibly characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration, is required for induction of aberrant DNA methylation., Regarding the responsible cytokines or molecules, increased expression of Cxcl2, Il1b, and Tnf (which encode cytokines) and Nos2 (which encodes nitric oxide (NO) synthase) were present in gastric mucosae of gerbils with H. pylori infection, but not in those of gerbils exposed to ethanol- or salt-induced inflammation [42]. The potential involvement of IL1B in human gastric cancer is further evidenced by the association between polymorphisms in the IL1B promoter and gastric cancer susceptibility, especially among individuals with H. pylori infection [59, 60], although Il1b-deficient mice were resistant to H. pylori-induced gastric cancers [61]. IL1B promoter polymorphisms were also associated with the presence of the CpG island methylator phenotype, a distinct phenotype with frequent aberrant DNA methylation of multiple CpG islands, in gastric cancers [62]. Also, treatment of gastric cancer cell lines (TMK-1, MKN-74, and MKN-7) with IL-1Î² has been reported to have induced the methylation of tumor-suppressor gene CDH1, based on a conventional methylation-specific PCR [62, 63]., NO, whose production is enhanced by an H. pylori extract [64] and IL-1Î² [65], was reported to upregulate the enzyme activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) without affecting mRNA expression levels [65]. However, the enhancement of DNMT activity by NO has not been confirmed since then. In addition, no changes in the mRNA level of genes encoding DNMTs have been observed in human or gerbil stomachs infected with H. pylori [25, 66] and in mouse colonic epithelial cells exposed to chronic inflammation [67]. Therefore, the molecules involved in the addition or maintenance of a methyl group are unlikely to be affected, and we suggest that factors that protect DNA from methylation, such as TET proteins, are likely to be affected by chronic inflammation, possibly via signals from macrophages, such as IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, or NO (Fig. 1)., EBV was the first virus detected in human neoplastic cells (in a Burkittâs lymphoma cell line), in 1964 [68], and is involved in several tumor types. It was recently shown to have a direct effect on induction of aberrant DNA methylation based on an infection system of recombinant EBV in vitro [19, 23, 24]., EBV infection is epidemiologically associated with development of human tumors, such as Burkittâs lymphoma, Hodgkinâs lymphoma, peripheral natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, smooth muscle tumor, NPCs, and gastric cancer [7]. EBV, a gamma-herpes virus consisting of double-stranded DNA, maintains itself as an episomal circular DNA in the nuclei of infected cells without the production of viral particles, and it is not integrated into the host genome [69, 70]. Although more than 90 % of the world population is infected with EBV before adolescence and become lifelong virus carriers, malignant neoplasms develop in a limited number of carriers., Approximately 10 % of all gastric cancer cases are EBV-associated, and monoclonal growth of EBV-infected gastric epithelial cells is detected in gastric mucosae [71]. Aberrant DNA methylation was observed more frequently in EBV+ cancers than in EBV- cancers [15], and hypermethylation of several specific genes, such as p73 and TFF1, has also been reported [72, 73]. Genome-wide effects of EBV on DNA methylation were revealed by Matsusaka et al. [74], and gastric cancers were categorized into three distinct groups, EBV- and low methylation, EBV- and high methylation, and EBV+ and extensively high methylation., In nasopharyngeal cancer, 70â90 % of the differentiated type is associated with EBV infection [75], and premalignant lesions of the nasopharyngeal epithelium are EBV+, suggesting the occurrence of EBV infection at an early step in carcinogenesis [76]. In primary cancers, aberrant DNA methylation has been observed at tumor-suppressor genes, including DAPK1, DLC1, p15, p16, and RASSF1A [77â79]. Significant association has been observed between the levels of promoter methylation of RASSF1A and TSLC1 tumor-suppressor genes and the quantity of EBV DNA detected in cancer tissues and in adjacent and distant non-cancerous tissues [78]., In lymphoma, EBV is present in over 95 %, 5â10 %, and 3â40 % of endemic, sporadic, and HIV-associated Burkittâs lymphoma cases, respectively [80], in approximately 40 % of Hodgkinâs lymphoma cases [81], and in 2â9 % of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cases [82]. Aberrant DNA methylation of tumor-suppressor genes, including BIM and PRDM1, was detected in EBV+ Burkittâs lymphoma cases but not in EBV- cases [83, 84]. Hansen et al. [85] identified large-scale hypomethylated blocks, which encompassed several Gb or were at least longer than 1 Mb, in EBV-transformed B cells by a genome-wide analysis, suggesting that at the early stage of EBV-associated carcinogenesis, global hypomethylation occurs first, leading to genome instability and eventually to the induction of aberrant DNA methylation., The causal role of EBV infection in inducing high levels of DNA methylation was confirmed by forcing EBV expression in a gastric cancer cell line and observing acquisition of new DNA methylation within 18 weeks [19]. Introduction of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), a viral oncoprotein from EBV, into a breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) activated DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, and induced methylation-silencing of tumor-suppressor gene CDH1 [86]. LMP1 directly activated the DNMT1 promoter via the JNK-AP1 pathway [87]. Latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) also induced DNMT1 overexpression via STAT3 activation [88], which led to methylation-silencing of tumor-suppressor gene PTEN. In contrast with epithelial cells, EBV infection of germinal center B cells, the presumptive progenitors of Hodgkinâs lymphoma, down-regulated DNMT1 and DNMT3B via LMP1, whereas DNMT3A was upregulated at the mRNA and protein levels [89]. Taken together, EBV infection is considered to induce aberrant DNA methylation by its direct effect, namely via dysregulation of DNMTs (Fig. 2).
                      Fig. 2
                        Molecular mechanisms of induction of aberrant DNA methylation by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. In gastric epithelial cells, EBV is transferred to normal epithelial cells from EBV-infected B lymphocytes. EBV produces multiple viral proteins, including latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A), which activates STAT3. STAT3 induces increased expression of DNMT1, leading to upregulation at the mRNA and protein levels. Upregulation of DNMT1 by STAT3 induces aberrant DNA methylation of multiple genes, including both driver (shown in blue) and passenger (shown in black) genes
                      , Infections by HBV and HCV induce chronic hepatitis, and are the major cause of HCC. Involvement of aberrant DNA methylation has been suggested by the increase of aberrantly methylated genes during disease progression (from chronic hepatitis to liver cirrhosis and to HCC). A recent report also showed the importance of the immune response in the induction of methylation by HBV or HCV [26]., HBV is a DNA virus and can be integrated into the host genome, leading to virus-related insertional mutagenesis of tumor-related genes [90]. However, it used to be considered that there was no consensus pattern of insertional mutations among HBV-induced HCC samples [3, 91, 92]. Recent whole-genome sequencing analysis of HCCs revealed that, although HBV was frequently integrated into the TERT locus, most other frequently mutated genes had incidences of less than 10 % [93, 94]. HCV is an RNA virus and cannot be integrated into the host genome, but HCV core protein interacts with multiple proteins of host cells and these interactions induce host responses [95, 96]., Epigenetically, similar to cancers of other tissues, HCCs are characterized by hypomethylation of repetitive sequences, associated with genomic instability, and aberrant DNA methylation of tumor-suppressor genes, such as RASSF1A, p16, SFRP1, GADD45A, and p15 [18, 97, 98]. These epigenetic alterations accumulate during the course of HCC development [99]. For example, decreased methylation at the LINE-1 and satellite 2 repetitive elements was mainly observed when chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis progressed to HCC [100], and methylation of CHFR and SYK, potential tumor-suppressor genes, increased in advanced HCC [101, 102]. These findings suggest that accumulation of aberrant DNA methylation in non-cancerous tissues, or an epigenetic field for cancerization that is predisposed to cancer development, may also be present in HCC, similar to that described above for H. pylori infection in gastric cancer., Importantly, the DNA methylation profile of liver cirrhosis and HCC is dependent on the type of hepatitis virus. Nishida et al. [103] showed that methylated loci were categorized into three groups: i) loci methylated in normal tissues and that showed increased methylation during HCC development; ii) loci methylated in non-cancerous and HCC tissues; and iii) loci methylated more densely and frequently in HCV+ HCC than in HBV+ and virus-negative HCC. Other analyses of genome-wide DNA methylation data also showed etiology-dependent methylation profiles of cirrhosis and primary HCC [104, 105]., Aberrant DNA methylation may be induced by direct action of a virus and also indirectly via chronic inflammation due to viral infection (Fig. 3). A direct action is known for an HBV protein, hepatitis B virus protein X (HBx). HBx was found to induce DNMT upregulation, leading to DNA methylation of the genes involved in the Ras pathway and angiogenesis [106], and to interact directly with DNMT3A to recruit it to the promoters of IL-4R, a gene encoding a cytokine receptor involved in apoptosis, and MT1F, a potential tumor-suppressor gene, leading to their methylation-silencing [107].
                      Fig. 3
                        Molecular mechanisms of induction of aberrant DNA methylation by hepatitis B virus (HBV). Two mechanisms of HBV-induced DNA methylation have been proposed: a direct effect via hepatitis B virus protein X (HBx) and an indirect effect via chronic inflammation. In the direct mechanism, after HBV infection of hepatocytes, viral DNA is transferred into the nucleus and transcribed. HBx is translated using the host machinery, transported back to the nucleus, and involved in upregulation of DNMT genes and recruitment of DNMTs to target genes. In the indirect mechanism, chronic inflammation triggered by HBV infection induces NK cell accumulation, increased Ifng expression, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Although the molecular details remain to be elucidated, an NK-cell-dependent innate immune response is important for methylation induction
                      , Chronic inflammation is also involved in the induction of aberrant DNA methylation and thus in the production of an epigenetic field for cancerization, similar to the gastric carcinogenesis associated with H. pylori infection (Fig. 3). Okamoto et al. [26] analyzed genome-wide DNA methylation in the livers of immunodeficient mice carrying human hepatocytes infected with HBV or HCV. In both systems, aberrant DNA methylation was induced, and the induction was associated with increased expression of an inflammation-related gene, Ifng, produced by NK cells, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. When NK cell activity was suppressed by the anti-asialo-GM-1 antibody, the induction of aberrant DNA methylation was suppressed, demonstrating that the NK-cell-dependent innate immune response was important for methylation induction [26]., Human papillomavirus (HPV) is related to the development of HNSCC and cervical cancers [108]. Although details of a mechanistic link between HPV and aberrant DNA methylation are still very limited, clinical application of aberrant DNA methylation in detection of cervical cancers is now actively being investigated [109]., HPV is a circular, double-stranded DNA virus, and more than 100 unique HPV types are known [110]. Among them, HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35 and 45 are high-risk HPV (hrHPV) [108]; 12.5â25 % of HNSCCs are associated with infection by hrHPV types 16, 33, or 35, and HNSCCs in the oropharynx are particularly strongly associated [110, 111]. Approximately 54 % and 17 % of invasive cervical cancer cases are associated with hrHPV types 16 and 18, respectively [112]., Promoter hypermethylation is considered to be a mechanism of HNSCC progression, although analysis has been limited to a small number of tumor-suppressor genes, such as p16, CDH1, RARÎ², MGMT, DAPK, DCC, GALR1, and GALR2 [113â115]. Methylation was more frequently observed in HPV+ cells than in HPV- cells, and DNMT3A expression was also higher in HPV+ cell lines [116â118]. Methylation levels of LINE-1 repetitive elements were higher in HPV+ HNSCC than in HPV- cancer cells [119]. This finding was interesting, considering that most cancer cells are characterized by global hypomethylation, including LINE-1 repetitive elements [100]. The authors [100] suggested that HPV-infected cells attempted to silence the virus by DNA methylation, which might have resulted in increased methylation of LINE-1 repetitive elements [119]., In cervical cancer, increased DNA methylation of tumor-suppressor genes, such as p16, FHIT, GSTP1, MAL and TSLC1, was observed [120â123]. Some of these genes, such as CADM1 and MAL, were also methylated in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), a precancerous lesion associated with hrHPV infections [124, 125], providing the presence of an accumulation of aberrant DNA methylation in non-cancerous tissues, or an epigenetic field for cancerization, which is predisposed to cancer development., A common characteristic of infection-associated cancers is the presence of an epigenetic field for cancerization [18â20]. In addition to infection-associated cancers, cancers associated with inflammation due to causes other than infection (inflammation-associated cancer), such as Barrettâs cancer of the esophagus, are also associated with an epigenetic field [126]. Furthermore, prostate and breast cancers, both of which are associated with hormonal signals [21], are also associated with an epigenetic field [127, 128]. In addition, DNA methylation in non-cancerous tissues has been associated with tumor aggressiveness and worse patient outcome [129]. These findings indicate that opportunities for cancer prevention, diagnosis, and therapy are potentially widely applicable. In particular, cancer risk diagnosis is now reaching a level of clinical use. Examples of such applications for clinical management of infection-associated cancers are summarized in Table 2.Table 2

A recent multicenter prospective cohort study convincingly demonstrated the clinical utility of this concept [22]. In the study, a gastric mucosal biopsy sample was obtained from 826 patients who had undergone endoscopic resection of a gastric cancer, and DNA methylation levels of three preselected marker genes, EMX1, NKX6-1, and miR-124a-3 [47, 130], were measured. After a median follow-up of 2.97 years, the patients with a high methylation level of miR-124a-3 were shown to develop metachronous gastric cancers with a statistically higher incidence (hazard ratioâ=â2.3, pâ=â0.042). In addition, several promising DNA methylation markers have been identified through retrospective cohort studies [131â133]., Epigenetic cancer risk diagnosis is expected to achieve cancer risk prediction that is very difficult by other means. This is because the assessed epigenome alteration is considered to reflect a patientâs life history, including exposure to environmental carcinogenic factors and how strongly the sampled tissue responded to the carcinogens. Also, DNA methylation levels can be measured precisely and therefore have a methodological advantage. The use of the extent or âseverityâ of the epigenetic field as a cancer risk marker is expected to be applicable to various types of cancers., In HPV-associated cervical cancers, DNA methylation markers have been found to be useful for triage of hrHPV-positive women as a tool for screening [134]. Several methylation biomarkers were able to distinguish cervical samples with intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN2 or 3) from those with CIN1 or without any intraepithelial lesions or malignancy [135â137]. A recent prospective randomized clinical trial by Verhoef et al. [109] compared methylation of preselected marker genes MAL and miR-124-2 with cytology using self-collected cervicovaginal specimens and showed that methylation triage was at least as sensitive as cytology triage for detection of CIN2 or worse. This large-scale randomized prospective study clearly demonstrates the power of epigenetic analysis in detecting cervical cancer., In EBV-associated NPC, Hutajulu et al. [138] detected aberrant methylation of four tumor-suppressor genes (DAPK1, DLC1, CDH13, and CADM1) in DNA from nasopharyngeal brushing samples of cancer patients, high-risk subjects, and healthy EBV carriers, and also detected DNA methylation of CDH1, DAPK1, and p16 in the peripheral blood of NPC patients. These reports indicated that the DNA methylation of these genes might be a useful serological marker for screening of primary and local or regional recurrent NPC [139]., Suppression of accumulation of aberrant DNA methylation or elimination of accumulated methylation is expected to lead to a decreased cancer incidence. This concept has been supported by evidence in genetically engineered animal models for colon tumors [140â142], lung tumors [143], blood cancers [144, 145], and squamous cell carcinomas in the tongue and the esophagus [146]. The mechanism has been explained by the induction of cellular differentiation and impairment of stem cell function by decreased methylation due to reduced expression of Dnmt1 [141, 145]. Also, administration of a DNA demethylating agent, such as 5-aza-2â²-deoxycytidine, suppressed tumorigenesis in animal models for intestinal tumors [147], prostate cancer [148, 149], and breast cancer [150]., The plausibility of this strategy in infection-associated cancers is of broad interest considering the large population affected by these types of cancers. Niwa et al. [151] showed that administration of 5-aza-2â²-deoxycytidine could suppress the development of H. pylori-induced gastric cancers in Mongolian gerbils. In humans, because epidemiological studies have shown an inverse association between the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and incidence of colorectal cancer disease-related death, NSAIDs are used to prevent colorectal cancers [152]. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain the inverse association, including enhancement of apoptosis of colonic epithelia [153, 154]. Therefore, it seems possible that suppression of induction of epigenetic alterations might be effective in infection-associated cancers., Regarding cancer therapy, epigenetic drugs have been developed that target DNA methyltransferases and histone modification regulators (deacetylases, methyltransferases, demethylases, and readers). DNA demethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors have already been approved for hematological malignancies [155, 156]. Clinical trials for a broader range of tumors, including solid tumors, are being extensively conducted, and various combinations of different epigenetic drugs, or an epigenetic drug and an anti-cancer drug, are also being attempted. Although the targets of epigenetic drugs do not appear to be specific to infection-associated cancers compared with other cancers, infection-associated cancers may have more targets because infection is a potent inducer of epigenetic alterations, and some of these cancers might be a good subpopulation for epigenetic therapy., The induction of aberrant DNA methylation now appears to be the major mechanism by which viral and bacterial infections in various tissues can induce cancer. Therefore, the remaining crucial question is the molecular mechanism by which viral and bacterial infections induce epigenetic alterations. It is clear that, for multiple types of infections, aberrant DNA methylation is induced via chronic inflammation, but the molecular mechanisms by which chronic inflammation induces aberrant DNA methylation are mostly still unclear. At the same time, some pathogens, such as EBV and HBV, directly interfere with epigenetic regulators. Clarification of these molecular mechanisms will have great value in identifying novel targets for cancer prevention., An epigenetic field for cancerization is a common characteristic of infection-associated cancers. In addition, cancers associated with chronic inflammation due to causes other than infection also have an epigenetic field [126], because chronic inflammation is a potent inducer of aberrant DNA methylation. Furthermore, the presence of an epigenetic field has been reported for hormone-associated cancers [21]. The direct action of hormones on epigenetic machinery has been suggested [157], and more research in this area is also important., Epigenetic field cancerization provides a broad range of opportunities for cancer diagnosis, prevention, and therapy. The âseverityâ of an epigenetic field for cancerization is promising as a cancer risk marker, as evidenced by the multicenter prospective cohort study for metachronous gastric cancer [22]. Epigenetic cancer risk markers are considered to reflect the life history of individuals and thus can be effective because environmental exposure is a major cause of human cancers [158]. To bring the markers identified in retrospective cohort studies into practice, more prospective studies in settings with high clinical value are necessary. Early detection of cancer is also a promising application of epigenetic markers, and comparison of sensitivity and specificity with markers now used in clinical practice is necessary., The use of an epigenetic field as a target of cancer prevention is also awaited. Given that the usefulness of suppression of aberrant DNA methylation has been shown for various types of tumors in animal models, development of a method with minimal adverse effects appears essential. However, current DNA demethylating agents decitabine and azacytidine are mutagenic [159] and cannot be used for cancer prevention. Meanwhile, suppression of chronic inflammation is expected to have preventative value through multiple mechanisms [153, 154]. Drug repositioning, which uses drugs already shown to be safe, may also become a useful strategy to identify drugs targeting aberrant DNA methylation or an epigenetic field, leading to inhibition of infection-associated carcinogenesis., Epigenetic therapy is currently approved only for hematological malignancies, and as mentioned earlier its application to solid tumors is actively being investigated [160]. Because epigenetic alterations are induced by infection and the resultant chronic inflammation, it is possible that at least some infection-associated cancers will show a good response to epigenetic therapy. If so, identification of epigenomic signatures in tumors that will respond appears to be a topic worthy of investigation., Aberrant histone modifications have received relatively limited attention, although they appear to occur more often and much earlier than aberrant DNA methylation in a mouse colitis model [27]. One major reason why only a limited number of studies are available is the technical difficulty of quantifying histone modifications, especially for diagnostic applications. Development of a method for precise measurement of histone modifications would advance the field. From preventative and therapeutic viewpoints, many inhibitors of histone modification enzymes and readers are currently being developed [155], and aberrant histone modification induced by infection may be a promising target., Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, DNA methyltransferases, Epstein-Barr virus, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis B virus protein X, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Hepatitis C virus, Head and neck squamous cell cancers, Human papillomavirus, High-risk HPV, Latent membrane protein, Nitric oxide, Nasopharyngeal cancer, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, Reactive oxygen species"

The method yields string-of-bead vaccines with flexible spacer lengths that increase the predicted epitope recovery rate fivefold while reducing the immunogenicity from neo-epitopes by 44 % compared to designs without spacers., One of the most promising approaches of rational vaccine design uses so-called epitope-based vaccines (EVs). Vaccines based on T-cell epitopes, short immunogenic peptide sequences derived from antigens, offer several advantages over traditional whole attenuated or subunit vaccines [1]. Unlike traditional vaccines, EVs do not contain potentially infectious material and the selection of peptides can be tailored to address the genetic variation of pathogens and that of a target population or of an individual patient. Well-established techniques for peptide synthesis guarantee rapid high-quality production and an economical storage of the final vaccine [1]., Rational development of EVs relies on bioinformatics for prediction of viable epitopes. Machine-learning methods, such as probabilistic models, neural networks, and support vectors machines, are routinely used with high accuracy for epitope prediction [2â5]. Different algorithms have been suggested as well for selecting an optimal set of epitopes for EV design, each emphasizing different aspects of EVs [6â10]. Among these approaches is OptiTope, a mathematical framework that relies on integer linear programming, which can easily be adapted to many different settings and types of EVs [8, 11]., Nevertheless, the stability and delivery of EVs remain major obstacles. Several strategies have been explored in clinical studies and range from administration of peptide cocktails to assembly of selected peptides into polypeptides [12]. One popular approach concatenates the epitope sequences, like beads on a string, to create a string-of-beads vaccine (SBV, Fig. 1a). The efficacy of an SBV depends on the processing of the polypeptide such that the majority of desired T-cell epitopes are recovered and subsequently presented by human leucocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. A major factor for optimal recovery is the correct cleavage of the epitopes. It has been shown that recovery of the epitopes is strongly linked to the ordering of the peptides within the SBV due to its influence on the cleavage probability [13]. An unfavorable order can lead to miscleaved peptides and thus, to an ineffective vaccine (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, new cleavage sites and neo-epitopes can arise from non-native sequences at junctions between epitopes and/or spacers. These neo-epitopes can also have detrimental effects [14] (Fig. 1b).

                      Rational string-of-beads design. a Design process of a string-of-beads vaccine (SBV). Given a set of antigen candidates, epitopes are derived either experimentally or computationally. A selection of n candidate epitopes is determined, which form the basis of the SBV. These epitopes are either directly combined into a polypeptide or small connecting sequences (spacers) are used to link adjacent epitopes. In total, there are n! possibilities to arrange n epitopes into a SBV. b Possible cleavage outcomes of a SBV. The efficacy of a SBV depends on correct proteasomal cleavage. Desired is a cleavage pattern that correctly recovers all contained epitopes (1). Not all junction cleavage sites might be cleaved, which results in a partly cleaved and less effective SBV (2). Cleavage of the SBV at non-junction sites can create neo-epitopes. Generation of neo-epitopes can induce unwanted immune responses and reduces the amount of desired epitopes generated by the SBV (3)
                                 
                    , To improve the recovery of epitopes in SBVs, several groups have suggested the use of spacer sequences between epitopes [15â17] (Fig. 1a). However, it is unclear how to determine the optimal length and amino acid sequence of a spacer to exploit fully its potential. Furthermore, with increasing spacer length, the problem of induced neo-epitopes and new arising cleavage sites becomes increasingly challenging. In addition, experimentally testing designs to determine an optimal SBV, even without considering spacer sequences, quickly becomes infeasible. A dozen epitopes can be combined into about half a billion (12!) distinct SBV sequences. Considering additional spacer sequences with flexible length, increases the possibilities many times over. For instance, allowing spacer sequences up to a length of three for 12 epitopes results in over 44 trillion possible designs. For simplicity, most SBV designs have so far used fixed spacer sequences. Until now, only a few computational approaches have been proposed to address the epitope assembly problem (i.e., the problem of choosing the right epitope order). Vider-Shalit et al. suggested a genetic algorithm that simultaneously performs epitope selection and assembly [6]. Toussaint et al. reduced the epitope assembly problem to the well-known traveling salesperson problem (TSP) and solved it heuristically or optimally via integer linear programming [7]. Neither of these approaches considers spacer sequences though., In this work, we propose an approach to determine a provably optimal spacer sequence of fixed length for a given HLA-I restricted epitope pair. We also extend the formulation to determine the optimal spacer length and combine this approach with that of Toussaint et al. [7] to design an optimal SBV with flexible spacer sequences. Additionally, we account for the problem of arising neo-epitopes and cleavage sites by formulating the problem of designing a spacer sequence as a multi-objective optimization problem that maximizes the recovery probability of the desired epitopes, minimizes the immunogenicity of neo-epitopes, and (optionally) minimizes the cleavage probability at non-junction sites at the same time. We focus our efforts solely on HLA-I antigen processing, since computational prediction methods for proteasomal cleavage and HLA-I binding are well established. The cleavage-site prediction models are used for designing spacer sequences and for ordering the therapeutic epitopes of the SBV to increase their cleavage likelihood artificially, whereas the HLA-I binding prediction models are used to hinder the formation of neo-epitopes at the epitopeâspacer interfaces. Note that an experimental determination of such an optimal design is virtually impossible due to the vast number of possible designs; a computational approach is, thus, indispensable., Our results indicate there is a strong increase in the number of correctly cleaved epitopes and a decrease in the neo-immunogenicity of the complete construct compared to SBV designs with commonly used fixed spacers and optimally arranged SBVs without spacer sequences., The goal of the optimization is to design a SBV based on a given set of N epitopes. The SBV construct will contain all epitopes, but the ordering of the epitopes, as well as the length and sequence of the N â 1 spacers between these epitopes, is variable. The SBV is designed in a way that (a) maximizes the recovery of the epitopes while (b) minimizing the production of undesired neo-epitopes., More formally: Given a set E of N epitopes e

                           N
                  , we specify an optimal spacer s
                           ij
                   of length k defined over the alphabet of amino acids Î£ that connects two epitopes \( {e}_i\in {\Sigma}^{\left|{e}_i\right|} \) and \( {e}_j\in {\Sigma}^{\left|{e}_j\right|} \) as the sequence that maximizes the likelihood of it being cleaved at the respective junction cleavage sites c
                           i
                   and c
                           j
                   of the two epitopes. This increases the likelihood of recovering all desired epitopes (Fig. 1b), which in turn increases the likelihood of them being loaded and presented on HLA-I molecules. If only a few epitopes are correctly processed and neo-epitopes are formed (Fig. 1b), the influence of these neo-epitopes on the immunological processes should be minimized, so that the risk of undesired immune responses is reduced. This can be achieved by designing the spacer sequences in such a way that the potential neo-epitopes spanning the connected epitopes e
                           i
                  , e

                           ij
                   are minimally immunogenic. To approach this problem computationally, proteasomal cleavage and immunogenicity prediction models are needed. In T-cell epitope prediction, proteasomal cleavage prediction was found to have a minor impact on prediction performance [18, 19]. However, in the context of in silico string-of-beads design, its impact is much more pronounced. Here, accurate cleavage prediction is important for predicting the recovery probabilities of the desired epitopes of the SBV, maximizing the individual cleavage probability by rearranging the order of the epitopes, and optimizing spacer sequences. These effects have been shown to be essential for a vaccineâs efficacy in several experimental studies [13â16]., In the following, we describe the prediction models used and derive the mathematical formulation to tackle the problem of designing a SBV with flexible spacer sequences. It should be mentioned that the developed framework is restricted to linear prediction methods. Non-linear prediction models, like artificial neural networks (e.g., NetMHC [3]), or even more complex prediction approaches like the one proposed by Zhang et al. [19], would lead to a non-convex, non-linear mixed integer optimization problem that cannot be solved efficiently and optimally even for small instances [20]. Furthermore, the linear prediction methods have to be fully integrated into the optimization framework to be able to solve the corresponding optimization problem efficiently. Integrated linear methods for epitope and cleavage prediction are listed in âImplementationâ., For cleavage site prediction, we employ the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) Ï

                  , one has to consider multiple design goals. On the one hand, the spacer sequence should be designed to maximize the cleavage probabilities of the cleavage sites c

                   and c

                  . Such problems can be conveniently described as multi-objective optimization problems. Solving a multi-objective optimization problem yields Pareto-optimal solutions that resemble trade-offs between all objective functions., Most approaches for solving multi-objective optimization problems use scalarization techniques combining the different objectives [21]. A common approach linearly combines the objectives weighted by a coefficient reflecting the designersâ preferences. However, identifying the best weights is difficult because (a) the numerical properties of the objective functions usually differ and (b) the effect of the defined weights is hard to determine a priori., Since our stated problem exhibits a clear ordering of the objectives with respect to their priority, namely junction-cleavage likelihood over neo-immunogenicity, the problem of finding a Pareto-optimal solution can be significantly simplified by applying lexicographical ordered optimization (LO). In LO, the objectives are ordered based on their importance and several single objective problems of the following form are iteratively solved:$$ \begin{array}{l}\underset{x}{ \min }{f}_i(x)\\ {}\mathrm{s}.\mathrm{t}.\kern0.28em {f}_j(x)\le {f}_j\left({x}^{\ast}\right)\\ {}\mathrm{where}\kern0.28em i\in \left\{1,N\right\},\kern0.28em j\in \left\{1,i-1\right\}\kern0.28em \mathrm{if}\kern0.28em i>1,\end{array} $$ (3)where i represents the priority of the objective function, and f

                  (x

                  *) the optimum of the jth objective function found at the jth iteration [22]. Note that after the first iteration, f

                  (x
                           j

                  (x), since new constraints have been added to the problem formulation., We now formulate the problem of designing a spacer of fixed length k as a bi-objective mixed integer linear program (ILP). We represent each position i and amino acid a of the concatenated sequence of spacer and epitope pairs with a binary decision variable x
                           i,a
                           . Additionally, we allow all 20 amino acids to appear within the spacer sequence. A constraint has to be added to allow only one amino acid per position. The complete Pareto formulation has, thus, the following form:$$ \begin{array}{l}\underset{x}{ \max}\sum_{l=0}^{n_c-1}\left(\sum_{a\in {S}_{i_c+l}}{x}_{i_c+l,a}{\phi}_C\left(a,l\right)+\sum_{b\in {S}_{j_c+l}}{x}_{j_c+l,b}{\phi}_C\left(b,l\right)\right)\\ {}\underset{x}{ \min}\sum_{h\in H}{p}_h\sum_{i=1}^{n-{n}_e} \max \left(0,\left(\sum_{j=0}^{n_e-1}\sum_{a\in {S}_{i+j}}{\mathrm{x}}_{i+j,a}{\phi}_{\mathrm{I}}\left(h,a,j\right)\right)-{\tau}_h\right)\\ {}\mathrm{s}.\mathrm{t}.{\displaystyle \sum_{a\in {S}_i}}{x}_{i,a}\le 1,\kern0.75em \forall i\in \left\{1,n\right\},\end{array} $$ (4)where S
                           i
                   denotes the set of amino acids allowed at position i., Following the LO definition, we solve two consecutive ILPs to yield a lexicographically optimal solution:$$ \begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{LO}}_{\mathrm{spacer}}\left({e}_i,{e}_j,k\right)\ :=\\ {}\begin{array}{cc}\mathrm{P}1\hfill & \begin{array}{l}{z}_1^{*}:=\underset{x}{ \max }{\displaystyle \sum_{l=0}^{n_c-1}}\left({\displaystyle \sum_{a\in {S}_{i_c+l}}}{x}_{i_c+l,a}{\phi}_C\left(a,l\right)+{\displaystyle \sum_{b\in {S}_{j_c+l}}}{x}_{j_c+l,b}{\phi}_C\left(b,l\right)\right)\\ {}\mathrm{s}.\mathrm{t}.\kern1em {\displaystyle \sum_{a\in {S}_i}}{x}_{i,a}\le 1, \kern0.5em \forall\ i\in \left\{1,n\right\}\end{array}\hfill \end{array}\\ {}\begin{array}{cc}\hfill \mathrm{P}2\hfill & \hfill \begin{array}{l}{z}_2^{*}: = \underset{x}{ \min }{\displaystyle \sum_{h\in H}}{p}_h{\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{n-{n}_e}} \max \left(0,\left({\displaystyle \sum_{j=0}^{n_e-1}}{\displaystyle \sum_{a\in {S}_{i+j}}}{x}_{i+j,a}{\phi}_I\left(h,a,j\right)\right)-{\tau}_h\right)\\ {}\mathrm{s}.\mathrm{t}.\kern1em {\displaystyle \sum_{a\in {S}_i}}{x}_{i,a}\le 1,\kern0.75em \forall\ i\in \left\{1,n\right\}\\ {}{\displaystyle \sum_{l=0}^{n_c-1}}\left({\displaystyle \sum_{a\in {S}_{i_c+l}}}{x}_{i_c+l,a}{\phi}_C\left(a,l\right)+{\displaystyle \sum_{b\in {S}_{j_c+l}}}{x}_{j_c+l,b}{\phi}_C\left(b,l\right)\right)\ge \alpha {z}_1^{*}\end{array}\hfill \end{array}\end{array} $$
                        , Here, we restrict P2 to obtain at least Î± â [0, 1] fraction of the maximal cleavage score achieved by solving P1. Î± represents the trade-off between cleavage likelihood and the likelihood of decreasing the immunogenicity score., To design a complete string-of-beads with flexible spacer lengths, the introduced LO formulation is iteratively solved for each pair e
                           i
                  , e
                           j
                  â E of epitopes with varying spacer length k â {0, â¦, K}. The design with the highest minimum of both cleavage site likelihoods is selected and the scores obtained are used to initialize a fully connected and directed graph, where the negative cleavage scores represent the weights of the edges between epitopes pairs. Following Toussaint et al., a TSP instance is formulated based on this graph by adding a node that represents the N- and C-termini of the SBV and connecting it with all other nodes with zero edge weights (Fig. 2). Solving this formulated TSP instance yields an optimal ordering of the epitopes. Together with the optimized spacers, we thus, obtain an optimal sequence for the entire vaccine construct. The description of the algorithm in pseudo-code can be found in Additional file 1.
                      Fig. 2
                        Example of a string-of-beads traveling salesperson (TSP) graph. Solving a TSP yields the shortest round trip, which visits each node exactly once. To solve the epitope assembly problem, each epitope is assigned to a node and artificial start and end nodes, representing the N- and C-terminals of the SBV, are added to the graph. The edges are weighted by the negative cleavage likelihood ratios of the two adjacent epitopes and labeled with the corresponding spacer of the epitope pair. Red edges mark the optimal round trip leading to an SBV of KLLEEVLLL-HDH-ALADGVQKV-HH-SVASTTTGV
                      , Besides the maximization of the junction cleavage likelihood, minimizing the likelihood of being cleaved at any other position will also improve the recovery probability of the therapeutic epitopes. Non-junction cleavage sites are partly influenced by the length of the spacer sequence and the epitope pairing. Therefore, we treat the minimization of non-junction cleavage sites as an optional third design goal and add to the sequence of consecutively solved ILPs a third optimization problem of the form:$$ \begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{LO}}_{\mathrm{spacerEx}}\left({e}_i,{e}_j,k\right):=\dots \\ {}\begin{array}{cc}\kern1em \mathrm{P}3\kern1em & \kern1em \begin{array}{l}\underset{x}{ \min}\sum_{i=1}^{n-{n}_c}\sum_{j=0}^{n_c-1}\sum_{a\in {S}_{i+j}}{x}_{i+j,a}{\phi}_C\left(a,j\right)\\ {}\mathrm{s}.\mathrm{t}.\sum_{a\in {S}_i}{x}_{i,a}\le 1,\kern0.75em \forall i\in \left\{1,n\right\}\\ {}\sum_{l=0}^{n_c-1}\left(\sum_{a\in {S}_{i_c+l}}{x}_{i_c+l,a}{\phi}_C\left(a,l\right)+\sum_{b\in {S}_{j_c+l}}{x}_{j_c+l,b}{\phi}_C\left(b,l\right)\right)\ge \alpha {z}_1^{\ast}\\ {}\sum_{h\in H}{p}_h\sum_{i=1}^{n-{n}_e} \max \left(0,\left(\sum_{\mathrm{j}=0}^{{\mathrm{n}}_{\mathrm{e}}-1}\sum_{a\in {S}_{i+j}}{x}_{i+j,a}{\phi}_{\mathrm{I}}\left(h,a,j\right)\right)-{\tau}_h\right)\le \left(2-\beta \right){z}_2^{\ast}\end{array}\kern1em \end{array}\end{array} $$
                        , Here again, Î± and Î² represent the trade-offs between the three objective functions. The influence of Î± and Î² on cleavage likelihood, neo-immunogenicity, and non-junction cleavage likelihood is depicted in Additional file 2., To solve the problem efficiently, the spacer design was parallelized and the TSP solution was approximated using the LinâKernighanâHelsgaun heuristic [23]. The model was implemented in Python 2.7 using Pyomo 4.0 [24] and solved with ILOG CPLEX 12.5 (www.âilog.âcom) and the LinâKernighanâHelsgaun heuristic [23]. The complete framework was integrated into EpiToolKit, a web-based platform for rational vaccine design. It can be accessed at www.âepitoolkit.âde under Spacer Design [25]. The source code and example files can be found at https://âgithub.âcom/âFRED-2/âOptiVac. The implementations currently support SYFPEITHI [2], BIMAS [26], SMM [27], and SMMPMBEC [28] for epitope prediction, and PCM [18] and ProteaSMM [29] for proteasomal cleavage prediction. The statistical analysis was conducted using R (www.âr-project.âorg). Statistical significance was considered at a significance level of 0.05. Data used in the statistical analysis can be found in Additional files 3 and 4., To validate the model performance, 1000 random epitope pairs, predicted for proteins of the cytomegalic virus strain AD169 (UniProt Proteom ID UP000008991), were generated and spacers of length 1â6 designed and optimized for the HLA distribution of the European population using Î±â=â0.99. The fold change in cleavage likelihood as well as neo-immunogenicity were compared for concatenated epitopes without spacers, a commonly used fixed spacer (AAY) [16, 30, 31], and with optimally determined spacers (Fig. 3).
                      Fig. 3
                        Fold change in cleavage likelihood and differences in neo-immunogenicity compared for 1000 randomly sampled epitope pairs. Spacers of lengths 1â6 were designed with the described model. The cleavage probability (a) and immunogenicity (b) were compared for epitope pairs concatenated without a spacer sequence, epitope pairs combined with a commonly used spacer sequence (AAY), and pairs combined with optimally designed spacers. Black error bars represent the 68 % confidence intervals
                      , For each spacer length, a significant increase in cleavage likelihood could be observed for epitope pairs with optimized spacers compared to epitope pairs without spacers (paired one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Bonferroni corrected). In addition, the optimized spacers outperformed the constructs with a fixed spacer after a length of two (paired one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Bonferroni corrected). The maximum increase in cleavage likelihood was achieved with a spacer length of four, which is not surprising since the applied cleavage model uses four C- and two N-terminal amino acids to predict a cleavage site. The use of optimal spacer sequences resulted in a 7.7-fold increase in cleavage likelihood compared to epitope pairs without spacer sequences and a twofold increase compared to epitope pairs with a fixed AAY spacer., In addition, significant improvements could be observed in terms of reduced neo-immunogenicity when using optimized spacers compared to both designs with fixed spacers and without spacers (paired one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Bonferroni corrected). With increasing spacer length, the immunogenicity decreased when using optimal spacer sequences. An average neo-immunogenicity reduction of 1.9-fold and 2.7-fold could be achieved at a spacer length of four compared to epitope pairs without spacers and fixed spacers, respectively. Detailed results can be found in Additional file 3., A pool of epitopes was produced. The epitopes were predicted to bind to at least one HLA allele present in a European population. Out of this pool, random sets of size l â {3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30} were selected. The optimal ordering was determined for the string-of-beads construct without (SBV) and with spacer sequences (SBVspacer) for a maximum spacer length of kâ=â6 amino acids. Additionally, ten randomly ordered strings-of-beads with fixed AAY spacers (SBVAAY) for the given epitope set were generated. This procedure was repeated 50 times for each set size. The junction cleavage likelihood averaged over the number of arising junction sites, the fraction of recovered epitopes (i.e., epitopes with preceding and succeeding C-terminal cleavage sites with positive cleavage score), as well as the neo-immunogenicity of the complete construct normalized by the number of included epitopes were compared between the strings-of-beads with a spacer, without spacer sequences, and the average performance of the random constructs with fixed spacers (Fig. 4).
                      Fig. 4
                        Comparison of string-of-beads with and without spacer sequences. Average junction cleavage likelihood (a), recovery percentage (b), and neo-immunogenicity (c) were measured for optimal string-of-beads designs with, without, and fixed AAY spacers. The string-of-beads constructs comprised three to 30 randomly selected epitopes. For each set size, the sampling was repeated 50 times. The maximum spacer length was set to kâ=â6. Black error bars and colored outlines represent the 68 % confidence intervals
                      , The average junction cleavage scores of SBVspacer and SBVAAY were stable and well above the cleavage threshold of 0.0 for all set sizes, with an average score of 1.74âÂ±â0.63 and 0.73âÂ±â0.53, respectively. The average junction cleavage score for SBV decreased with increasing set sizes and was below the cleavage threshold even for small set sizes with an average score of â0.85âÂ±â1.09. This was also reflected in the percentage of recovered epitopes. SBV exhibited a decreasing recovery with increasing set sizes with an average of 15.4âÂ±â24.3 %, while SBVspacer and SBVAAY achieved a stable average recovery of 78.3âÂ±â16.2 % and 62.7âÂ±â15.2 % corresponding to a fivefold and fourfold increase, respectively. SBVspacer also consistently outperformed SBVAAY, both in cleavage likelihood (2.38-fold increase) and recovery rate (1.25-fold increase)., The differences in neo-immunogenicity were not as strong, which is expected due to the chosen value of Î±. SBVspacer consistently achieved a lower neo-immunogenicity score (average 1.88âÂ±â0.59) than SBV (average 3.37âÂ±â0.93) and SBVAAY (average 4.31âÂ±â0.99), resulting in a decrease of 44.2 % and 56.8 %, respectively., The optimal spacer length averaged at 3.23âÂ±â0.50 amino acids. The run time for instances with 30 epitopes was 5 min on average (maximum 5.6 min) on current commodity hardware (12-core Intel Xeon E5-2620 running at 2 GHz). Detailed results can be found in Additional file 4., Several spacer sequences have been proposed in various settings ranging from a prophylactic vaccine to therapeutic cancer vaccine studies [15, 16, 30, 32â34]. However, these spacer sequences are not universally applicable and their usefulness is dependent on the epitope pairs they connect. To show the potential efficacy of the proposed model, we compared multiepitope studies that used spacers with our in silico designed spacers in terms of epitope recovery and induced neo-epitopes. An epitope was considered recovered if its preceding and succeeding cleavage sites were likely to be cleaved, as predicted by PCM (i.e. PCM scoreâ>â0.0). Neo-epitope prediction was performed with SYFPEITHI using the default threshold (i.e. SYFPEITHI scoreââ¥â20). Additionally, we computed the optimal ordering and selection of the experimental spacers similar to the approach in [35]., Levy et al. proposed a therapeutic multiepitope polypeptide consisting of HLA-A*02:01 restricted modified epitopes derived from different melanoma-associated antigens (gp100:209â217(210 M): IMDQVPFSV, gp100:280â288(288 V): YLEPGEVTV; Mart1:27â35(27 L): LAGIGILTV; tyrosinase: 368â376(370D): YMDGTMSQV) and showed the proteasomal-dependent efficacy in vitro using the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy donors and patients undergoing treatment [30]. To combine the selected peptides, a natively derived spacer sequence (RKSY(L)) as well as experimentally derived spacers (AAY and ALL/SSL) were used. The selected epitopes were included multiple times in the polypeptide combined with the different spacers to maximize the recovery probability. Therefore, we compared the different segments of the vaccine that were connected with the same spacer sequences (Fig. 5). Detailed results of the neo-epitope and cleavage site predictions can be found in Additional file 5.
                      Fig. 5
                        Comparison between experimentally used spacer sequences and in silico designed spacer sequences for the multiepitope polypeptide proposed by Levy et al. Red bars represent predicted epitopes and the intensity indicates overlapping epitopes at that position. The blue rectangles represent predicted C-terminal cleavage sites. Spacer sequences are marked in red. A tick indicates the start position of a predicted nine-mer epitope. Epitope and cleavage site predictions were performed with SYFPEITHI and PCM, respectively. A peptide was predicted as an epitope if its prediction score was equal to or above a threshold of 20 (default threshold of SYFPEITHI). A cleavage site was said to be cleaved if the predicted PCM score was above zero. An epitope was defined as recovered if both preceding and succeeding cleavage sites were predicted to be cleaved
                      , In general, the optimal SBV design outperformed the experimentally used spacer sequences both in terms of therapeutic epitope recovery and in reduced neo-epitope appearance. With the designed spacers, 100 % of therapeutic epitopes could be recovered without generating neo-epitopes spanning the spacer sequences. The experimentally used spacers, on the other hand, either generated neo-epitopes or were not able to recover an essential amount of the therapeutic epitopes. With the spacer RKSY(L), only one out of four epitopes could be recovered, and ALL induced five neo-epitopes spanning the spacer. The Mart1-derived epitope and the combination of SLL and AAY generated neo-epitopes and resulted in the recovery of one out of four epitopes only. Even the design with optimally ordered epitopes and selected experimental spacer sequences could not recover all epitopes and introduced neo-epitopes. To establish the effect of different (linear) epitope prediction methods, the comparison was repeated with different methods (BIMAS [26] and SMM [27]). The recovery analysis was again performed with PCM, and default thresholds for BIMAS (predicted T
                           1/2ââ¥â100) and SMM (predicted IC50ââ¤â500 nM) were used for neo-epitope detection. All therapeutic epitopes could be recovered using the in silico designed spacers with a smaller or equal number of neo-epitopes compared to the best experimentally used spacer sequence. While there are differences in detail between the methods, their overall behavior remained the same. Differences can be attributed to variations in the prediction accuracy of the methods (Additional file 5 and 6)., Similar results could be observed for the SBV construct proposed by Ding et al. [15] (Additional files 7 and 8). The proposed SBV was composed of T-cell epitopes derived from the hepatitis B virus X protein, which were combined with different spacer sequences to reduce the number of junction neo-epitopes. With the in silico designed spacer sequences, all therapeutic epitopes could be recovered without introducing neo-epitopes, whereas the experimentally used spacers induced neo-epitopes and were not able to recover all therapeutic epitopes., In this work, we propose a mathematical model for designing spacer sequences of flexible length for SBVs by exploiting existing proteasomal cleavage and epitope prediction methods. We combined the model with a TSP approach for optimal epitope ordering. We also addressed the problem of neo-epitopes and non-junction cleavage sites arising from spacer sequences and the order of the epitopes within the string-of-beads by extending the formulation with two additional objective functions. To solve the multi-objective optimization problem efficiently, we employ lexicographical optimization techniques., The efficacy of the model was shown by comparing the recovery rates and neo-immunogenicity of optimal designs with commonly used fixed spacer sequences and spacer-less designs. In each case, the optimal design led to increased predicted epitope recovery and reduced generation of neo-antigens., We also compared experimentally tested string-of-beads designs that used spacer sequences with our optimized designs. The experimentally used spacer sequences were often sub-optimally chosen for the connecting epitopes. As a consequence, there were neo-epitopes spanning the spacer sequences or proteasomal cleavage could not be guided to cleave the therapeutic epitopes correctly. In contrast, the in silico designed string-of-beads with optimally determined spacers showed improved cleavage patterns and reduced neo-immunogenicity. Often all therapeutic epitopes could be correctly cleaved without introducing neo-epitopes., An obvious limitation of the current method is its reliance on computational models for proteasomal cleavage and epitope prediction. While models for HLA class I binding prediction exhibit a high accuracy, proteasomal cleavage models still leave room for improvements [36]. Currently, the approach is restricted to HLA class I epitopes but could be effortlessly extended once a cleavage prediction method for HLA-II ligands becomes available. In addition, the framework is designed flexibly enough to replace the underlying proteasomal cleavage prediction method, once more reliable computational prediction models are published. An experimental validation of selected optimal spacer designs is a non-trivial task. It cannot be performed as exhaustively as our computational study â the number of possible designs is simply too large. An experimental validation will thus, most likely, be limited to comparing only a few selected optimal designs to fixed spacer or spacer-less designs. Such validation is planned as future work together with experimental partners., In conclusion, our method is a first framework that optimally designs both epitope order and spacers for SBV design. The mathematical method employs state-of-the-art prediction methods, but does not depend on specific methods. Our model predicts an increased recovery of desired epitopes and a reduced production of neo-epitopes compared to both fixed spacer and spacer-less designs., epitope-based vaccine, human leucocyte antigen, integer linear program, lexicographical ordered optimization, position-specific scoring matrix, string-of-beads, traveling salesperson problem,

Cleavage likelihood and neo-immunogenicity decrease linearly with Î±. For the conservatively chosen Î±â=â0.99, Î² influences neo-immunogenicity only marginally. Once Î± is further decreased, Î² influences neo-immunogenicity in a non-linear manner. Similar behavior can be seen for the non-junction cleavage likelihood.

"Section of Biomolecular Medicine, Division of Computational and Systems Medicine, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"	"2016-01-21"	"Progress in personalized medicine is now being translated to personalized nutrition. A recent proof-of-concept study shows that the increase in blood glucose levels after a meal is highly variable between individuals, but can be predicted by using a computational model that combines information from gut microbiome profiles and dietary questionnaires. This study raises questions about the usefulness of universal diet recommendations, and suggests we might need to move on to personalized diets., More than a third of adults in the Western world who are over 20 years old have the metabolic syndrome [1]. The clinical definition of the metabolic syndrome varies but it typically includes at least three of the following symptoms: obesity, raised blood glucose levels, increased blood cholesterol levels and increased blood pressure, which together increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The common denominator behind the metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance, that is, a lack of sensitivity of peripheral organs to insulin, which has emerged as the root mechanism explaining the occurrence of these disorders., After eating a meal, blood sugar levels increase in response to the absorption of digested nutrients. This postprandial glycemic increase (that is, the postprandial glycemic response (PPGR)) triggers secretion of insulin by pancreatic ÃÂ² cells. Increased levels of circulating insulin result in glucose uptake by peripheral organs, such as the liver, muscles and adipose tissue, and a return of blood glucose levels towards their normal physiological concentrations. Insulin resistance reduces the ability of the body to regulate blood glucose levels, which results in an increased PPGR despite increased insulin secretion. Insulin resistance and an increased PPGR are major risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes. In a recent study published in Cell, the teams of Eran Elinav and Eran Segal developed a personalized nutrition approach to predict PPGRs [2]., The metabolic syndrome has devastating consequences in economic and public health and in the quality of life of patients. Pharmacological approaches and surgical interventions such as bariatric surgery are effective in improving glycemic control and reducing weight. In particular, bariatric surgery remains the only effective way to cure type 2 diabetes. Despite the efficacy of these strategies, stomach stapling surgery has associated risks, just as taking pills for weight loss., Dietary interventions are the easiest changes to implement in patients with the metabolic syndrome and offer a key lifestyle alternative to medication and surgery that has minimal adverse effects. These diets tend to follow universal guidelines, which recommend limiting the number of ingested calories while reducing fat and carbohydrate intake. These diets typically result in weight loss and improvement of glycemic control (reduction of PPGRs), but predicting which patients will respond to a particular diet is hard. Prediction of metabolic health in general, and PPGRs in particular, has remained empirical; genetics only explains a small amount of the variation in these factors and there is currently no effective way of predicting how each individual patient will respond to a particular diet., Our gut bacteria, collectively known as our gut microbiome, have a massive role in influencing the development of diabetes and obesity. The gut microbiome is now recognized as a key driver of inter-individual variation in the likelihood of developing obesity and diabetes. Individual microbiomes tend to cluster into enterotypes, which are communities within a statistical continuum that tend to be dominated by one phylum. Enterotypes are independent of age, sex and geographical location. Long-term dietary habits tend to influence these enterotypes. High intake of animal protein and fat, in particular, favors the growth of Bacteroides, whereas carbohydrate intake promotes growth of Prevotella species [3]. Several studies have demonstrated that high ecological diversity of gut microbes is associated with good health, which is presumably due to an increase in the diversity of bacterial functions. Owing to progress in sequencing technologies, it is now possible to measure almost every microbial gene in the microbiome and even a simple measure such as counting the total number of genes (microbial gene richness) shows an intriguing relationship of this number with metabolic health. Patients with a low microbial gene count tend to have more severe obesity, have more inflammation and gain more weight than patients with a high microbial gene count [4]. Patients with a low microbial gene count also respond better to dietary intervention than patients with a high microbial gene count [5]. Hence, the microbiome is now emerging as both a biomarker and an actionable target responding to dietary intervention in personalized medicine., A recent article by Zeevi et al. combines longitudinal monitoring of PPGRs by wearable continuous glucose monitors, microbiome profile data and clinical information in a large cohort. The findings show that although individual PPGRs are hypervariable, they are predictable by Ã¢ÂÂbig dataÃ¢ÂÂ strategies, and suggest that personalized diets might be more successful than universal diets in controlling PPGRs. The researchers integrated various data types, including information on dietary intakes, anthropometric measurements, physical activity, sleepÃ¢ÂÂwake cycles, high-resolution long-term blood glucose monitoring and fecal metagenomics in a cohort of healthy and pre-diabetic volunteers [2]. The 800 volunteers self-reported nearly 10 million calories consumed over nearly 47 thousand meals and automatically captured 1.5 million glucose measurements using ergonomic and minimally invasive continuous glucose monitors. In the first part of the study, Zeevi et al. established that PPGRs are highly variable, which suggests that universal dietary recommendations might have limited utility., Having demonstrated the hypervariable nature of PPGRs, Zeevi and colleagues then analyzed individual anthropometric measurements, activity parameters and microbiome profiles to predict these responses. The researchers devised a machine-learning algorithm that is based on a gradient-boosting regression methodology, in which thousands of decision trees were derived to optimize the predictive value of the overall model. Careful calibration, with participants eating standardized meals, enabled the machine-learning algorithm to make precise predictions for real-life meals by bringing extra noise and coarse-grained resolution to the predictions, which are critical factors for modeling the human element in clinical studies. The investigators trained their model in the cohort of 800 individuals by using leave-one-out cross-validation and validated the model against an independent cohort of 100 volunteers., Finally, Zeevi and colleagues used their gradient-boosting regression approach to design personally tailored dietary interventions, aiming at improving PPGRs in a two-arm blinded randomized controlled trial. Following the acquisition of baseline data, use of the machine-learning algorithm improved PPGRs as well as expert-based diet selection approaches., The novel approach introduced by Zeevi et al. makes it possible to tailor diets to each individual. Although there was a high level of interpersonal variation among PPGRs, these were reproducible per person and per standardized meal and were associated with known risk factors. PPGR variability was also associated with clinical markers of diabetes (glycated hemoglobin levels), obesity (body mass index), liver function (alanine aminotransferase levels), inflammation (C-reactive protein levels), and, most importantly, with microbiome profiles. The bacterial taxa and microbial functions underlying these predictions were highly consistent with previous reports in the field, which further supports the robustness of the approach., This work is an important proof-of-concept study that incorporates the contribution of the microbiome in the prediction of dietary responses. The approach is part of a new translational aspect of microbiome research. Other studies have pioneered the use of genome-scale modeling of microbiome responses to dietary intervention, which predicted short-chain fatty acid and amino acid variation in blood [6]. The combination of large-scale volunteer recruitment with longitudinal phenotyping depth enabled the machine-learning algorithm to outperform current models and expert-based predictions, making this study a cornerstone in the field of personalized nutrition. This study further supports the role of the microbiome as a prodromal markerÃ¢ÂÂi.e., an early predictive markerÃ¢ÂÂin pathophysiology. From a computational medicine angle, the study highlights the power of harnessing deep, longitudinal phenotyping by Ã¢ÂÂbig dataÃ¢ÂÂ strategies, which is critical to crack the code of complex individual response patterns and achieve individual predictions., This visionary study will undoubtedly influence the setup of nutritional interventions for the metabolic syndrome, but many questions remain unanswered. Will personalized diets based on big data predictions outweigh surgical and pharmacological interventions? Can metagenomic profiles and big data be used to gain a deeper understanding of the roles played by the microbiome in metabolic diseases? By adding more constraints to the machine-learning algorithm, is it possible to improve PPGRs whilst reducing aortic plaque formation or systemic inflammation?, This work clearly opens up new perspectives in the improvement of tailored dieting strategies, but a remaining challenge is increasing the availability of the enabling technology and the assessment of this machine-learning strategy in multicentric studies in various populations. Nonetheless, deploying these deep phenotyping and metagenomic strategies would certainly help patients with impaired glucose tolerance and obesity to have truly personalized diets. The ability to generate a personal baseline database including anthropometric measurements, blood test data, microbiome profiles and dietary reports obtained with smartphone-based apps is a powerful tool in terms of public health, patient engagement and patient outreach., This work illustrates the global push for long-term phenotyping [7], metabolomics-assisted decision-making in surgical environments [8] and predicting the outcomes of toxicological interventions [9]. We are witnessing the marriage of deep metagenomics with wearable technology in personalized nutrition. This methodology is likely to affect patient handling in nutritional interventions, with diet recommendations probably shifting from universal guidelines, often criticized, to personalized diets.

                Background
                Large tumor genome sequencing projects have now uncovered a few hundred genes involved in the onset of tumorigenesis, or drivers, in some two dozen malignancies. One of the main challenges emerging from this catalog of drivers is how to make sense of their heterogeneity in most cancer types. This is key not only to understand how carcinogenesis appears and develops in these malignancies to be able to early diagnose them, but also to open up the possibility to employ therapeutic strategies targeting a driver protein to counteract the alteration of another connected driver.
              
                Methods
                Here, I focus on driver transcription factors and their connection to tumorigensis in several tumor types through the alteration of the expression of their targets. First, I explore their involvement in tumorigenesis as mutational drivers in 28 different tumor types. Then, I collect a list of downstream targets of the all driver transcription factors (TFs), and identify which of them exhibit a differential expression upon alterations of driver transcription factors.
              
                Results
                I identify the subset of targets of each TF most likely mediating the tumorigenic effect of their driver alterations in each tumor type, and explore their overlap. Furthermore, I am able to identify other driver genes that cause tumorigenesis through the alteration of very similar sets of targets.
              
                Conclusions
                I thus uncover these circuits of connected drivers which cause tumorigenesis through the perturbation of overlapping cellular pathways in a pan-cancer manner across 15 malignancies. The systematic detection of these circuits may be key to propose novel therapeutic strategies indirectly targeting driver alterations in tumors.

Furthermore, I am able to identify other driver genes that cause tumorigenesis through the alteration of very similar sets of targets., I thus uncover these circuits of connected drivers which cause tumorigenesis through the perturbation of overlapping cellular pathways in a pan-cancer manner across 15 malignancies. The systematic detection of these circuits may be key to propose novel therapeutic strategies indirectly targeting driver alterations in tumors., Cancer develops as a consequence of the accumulation of driver somatic alterations in genes which, in turn, modify critical cellular processes often referred to as the hallmarks of cancer [1, 2]. The catalog of driver genes involved in the development of several malignancies has grown in recent years, as a result of whole-exome and whole-genome analyses of cohorts of tumors, mainly within the framework of large international consortia [3, 4]. This has opened up the possibility to carry out systematic studies to uncover the repertoire of functionally related groups of driver genes. Exploiting the aforementioned catalogs of driver genes, for example, we recently revealed the mutational landscape of chromatin regulatory factors (CRFs) in cancer [5]. Driver genes have also been grouped by their proximity in a network of functional interactions or their membership to the same or cross-talking pathways [6â9]., There are two main reasons why the catalogs of cancer drivers produced by the aforementioned projects and others need to be broken down into related sets of genes for deeper analysis. First, while the most frequent drivers in these lists have been long known and studied in their involvement in tumorigenesis, many novel mid- and low-frequent drivers have emerged whose roles in cancer need to be systematically clarified. One step in this direction is thus to understand exactly which downstream genes and cellular processes become affected in the outcome of driver alterations. Second, uncovering the catalog of driver genes has revealed that at the level of genomic alterations, tumorigenesis possesses a very heterogeneous nature, with driver alterations in genes in the same pathway or in cross-talking pathways resulting in the same phenotype [2, 6â8]. This is the case, for instance, of loss-of-function mutations of TP53, amplifications of MDM2 and MDM4, and deletions of CDKN2A, all leading to evading apoptosis and uncontrolled proliferation in malignancies such as glioblastoma. Such cliques of drivers, suspect of producing the same set of downstream changes have been identified using algorithms that take advantage of their trend to be altered in a mutually exclusive manner across tumor samples [6â8]. Nevertheless, to date, the actual misregulation of genes or processes downstream these cliques has not been systematically proven or exploited with the purpose of identifying them. The heterogeneity of driver alterations in a tumor type presents a major challenge to the efforts to develop a comprehensive toolbox of targeted therapies to extend personalized cancer medicine driven by genomics information. In a recent study we showed that only 6 % of the tumors in a cohort of more than 4,000 could be treated employing currently approved targeted therapies [10]., In this work I have chosen transcription factors (TFs) as a case study to try to make sense of the heterogeneity of drivers in tumor types through their downstream alteration for two main reasons. First, several human TFs controlling the expression of sets of target genes involved in the hallmarks of cancer, as TP53 or MYC, are frequently involved in tumorigenesis upon somatic alterations. Second, because TFs directly regulate the expression of groups of genes (targets), one may intuitively think that the tumorigenic effect of their driver alterations could be measured by computing the level of misregulation of these targets. Here, I start by uncovering and describing 64 TFs involved in tumorigenesis across 28 malignancies. Then, to investigate how their somatic alterations result in cancerogenesis across 15 tumor types, I explore the misregulated targets of 42 of them for which I was able to gather data. Lists of significant targets for different TFs in the 15 tumor types under study are thus provided as an outcome of this work. Moreover, employing the sets of significant targets of driver TFs, I search for other connected drivers whose alterations result in the misregulation of significantly overlapping sets of genes. These driver circuits involving a TF and another connected driver (or partner) are also provided as an outcome of the study., I obtained the list of human TFs employed in this study from a catalog compiled by Vaquerizas et al. [11]. I retrieved all TFs rated as âaâ, âbâ, or âotherâ, which the authors refer to as a high-confidence dataset. This list comprised 1,391 TFs. From this paper I also obtained the information on all InterPro [12] domains of these 1,391 TFs, including the identifier and name of the domain, as well as its boundaries and its source database. I inherited the list of mutational driver genes across 28 malignancies from our recent study [10], which identified them on the basis of three methods that exploit complementary signals of positive selection of the pattern of mutations in the genes in the tumorigenic process [10, 13]. This catalog of mutational drivers included 459 genes. It also contained the most likely mode of action of each driver (loss-of-function (LoF) and activating (Act)), predicted by a random forest classifier trained on known tumor suppressors and oncogenes [14]. Unclassified driver TFs were considered for all relevant purposes as Act drivers. All drivers nominated by the aforementioned study are known to be expressed either in the tumors of the cohort where they act as drivers (in the case of TCGA cohorts), in a cohort of tumors of the same cancer type or in a cohort of tumors from the same organ [10, 13]., I retrieved all mutations detected in driver TFs across almost 7,000 tumors sequenced in 48 cohorts representing the 28 aforementioned tumor types from the Integrative Oncogenomics (IntOGen) platform [15] (www.âintogen.âorg). In the datasets downloaded from IntOGen, mutations had been already mapped to the amino acid positions of the affected proteins. I then computed the enrichment/depletion of mutations in each driver TF in each cohort of tumors as the Fisherâs test P value., I downloaded all germline variants detected across 65,000 exomes of different cohorts of donors from the database collected by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), Cambridge, MA (http://âexac.âbroadinstitute.âorg, downloaded in November 2014) [16]. Again, the data provided by the ExAC already comprised the amino acid coordinates of variants. I filtered out all variants with allele frequency below 10â4. For each domain of each TF, I counted the number of variants and somatic mutations observed within and outside the domain, and computed the relative enrichment of each domain for somatic mutations using Fisherâs test., I collected a list of targets of TFs gathering information from several databases. From HTRIdb [17], pazar [18], and TRANSFAC v. 7.4 via MSigDB [19, 20], I manually downloaded annotated targets of 283, 190, and 283 TFs, respectively. From the Additional Data of the paper by Gerstein et al. [21], I obtained targets detected by ENCODE, including both proximal and distal sites., To detect all putative driver alterations (mutations, amplifications, and deletions) across 15 TCGA cohorts of tumors (Additional file 5), I first downloaded CNA (continuous values per genomic segment) and expression data (processed RNAseq in the form of RPKMs) from synapse (syn300013). Also from synapse, I retrieved the mutations detected in 34 pancreatic carcinoma samples, not included within the datasets of somatic mutations obtained from IntOGen. Then, I declared the alteration of a driver TF in a tumor sample a driver alteration according to the following rules. (First, because drivers â and by extension driver TFs are defined by tumor type â the process described below was carried out for the driver TFs of each tumor type independently.) Both truncating â stop gained or lost, frame-shift, splice donor or splice acceptor â and missense mutations in LoF driver TFs were considered LoF driver mutations, while only missense mutations in Act driver TFs were considered Act driver mutations. To detect driver amplifications and deletions, I first identified LoF driver TFs whose deletions (CNA values below â0.75) caused a downregulation of their mRNAs and Act drivers whose amplifications (CNA values above 1) caused an upregulation of their mRNAs. Upregulation and downregulation were determined as significant (P value <0.05) MannâWhitney comparisons of the expression of each driver TF in samples with deletions âor amplifications â to samples with a number of copies close to normal (between â0.75 and 1). Then, I declared every deletion involving an LoF driver TF a driver deletion, and each amplification involving an Act driver TF a driver amplification. These were merged with LoF and Act driver mutations, respectively, to produce the final matrices of samples with driver alterations of each driver TF in each tumor type., The expression of each target in the samples bearing driver alterations of the TF and unaltered samples were then compared using a MannâWhitney test. From this comparison I excluded the samples bearing either amplifications or deletions of the target, according to the criteria mentioned above. I considered significant targets those with P value of the comparison below 0.05 and fold-change (log2) above 1 or below â1. The aim of this differential expression test is â regardless of the high overlap observed between the targets of TFs and the top-ranking misregulated genes in response to their knock-down â to identify the subset of targets of each TF which are actually misregulated upon alterations of the TF within the context of the tumor type under analysis. In this case, I compared the number of differentially expressed genes among the targets of a TF with differentially expressed genes detected within groups of randomly selected genes of the same size as the annotated targets. The results show a varying landscape, with some TF-tumor type combinations for which misregulated genes are mostly confined to the annotated targets, and others where differentially expressed genes are distributed both within and outside the targets. These are probably the result of incomplete annotation of TF targets, or of drastic changes in the transcriptional regulatory program in tumorigenesis., To determine the coincidence of the sets of significant targets of each driver TFs in a pair of tumor types I computed two metrics, the Jaccardâs index and the corrected (BenjaminiâHochberg) Fisherâs P value (q-value) of their overlap. The universe used to compute the latter was the whole list of potential targets of the TF collected from the four original sources., To compare the effect of truncating and missense mutations of TP53 on the expression of its targets, I pooled the absolute fold-change values of all targets in the comparison between samples bearing truncating mutations â or missense-mutations â of the TF and non-altered samples. I then compared both distribution of absolute fold-change with a MannâWhitney test., I downloaded the PathwayCommons2 Functional Interactions network [22] (version 6 downloaded in November 2014). I retained interactions between genes of types âin-complex-withâ, âinteracts-withâ, âneighbor-ofâ, âcontrols-phosphorylation-ofâ, and âcontrols-state-change-ofâ and discarded the rest. For every TF-tumor type combination I searched all connected non-TF drivers (partners) with no more than half of the samples with driver mutations overlapping between TF and partner. For each TF-partner pair I assessed whether the alterations of the partner cause tumorigenesis through the same pathway as alterations in the connected TF. To that end, I first repeated the search for significant targets detailed in the previous section comparing this time the expression of targets of the TF in samples bearing driver alterations of the partner and samples where neither the partner nor the TF bore driver alterations. This way I ensured that targets deemed significant in this search are not the result of alterations of the TF. As a proxy to the strength of the link between partner and TF in their causing tumorigenesis through alteration of the same cellular pathway, I computed the corrected (BenjaminiâHochberg) Fisherâs q-value of the overlap between the significant targets of alterations of the TF and the significant targets of the alteration of the partner., To carry out the sample level enrichment analysis (SLEA) [23] of upregulated and downregulated targets of sample TF-partner circuits, I first transformed the expression of targets to mean-centered values. Then, I employed the SLEA built-in capability of Gitools [24]. All heatmaps presented across figures were also constructed, configured, and exported using Gitools., I employed two recently published methods [25, 26] to assess the mutual exclusivity of alterations of groups of genes. I downloaded both mutex and Comet from the sites provided by the authors (http://âcode.âgoogle.âcom/âp/âmutex and http://âcompbio-research.âcs.âbrown.âedu/âcomet, respectively) and constructed and ran them as documented. In both cases I ran them on the set of driver alterations detected in the tumor datasets employed to detect the circuits explored in this work. In the case of Comet, I ran the run_exhaustive.py script., For both tools I limited the search for mutually exclusive genes to size two and filtered the altered genes to take into account for mutual exclusivity by the list of TFs and partners integrating the circuits assessed in each tumor type. I then categorized the mutual exclusivity of all potential driver circuits probed in this work (with at least one significantly misregulated downstream target gene) according to the results of both methods., Additional file 1: Figure S1 presents an overview of all the analyses carried out in this study., We had previously carried out an exhaustive analysis of whole-exome mutations of 48 cohorts of tumors obtained from 28 different malignancies (approximately 7,000 tumors in total) employing three computational methods that exploit complementary signals of positive selection and identified 459 mutational driver genes [10]. I started with this list of cancer driver genes obtained from the IntOGen platform. TFs are overrepresented among them (P valueâ=â3.9âÃâ10â8), with 64 proteins (Fig. 1 and Additional file 1: Figure S2) identified from a catalog of 1,391 human TFs [11]. I also retrieved the most likely mode of action of each driver TF upon alterations in tumorigenesis (either activating, LoF, or undetermined) across approximately 4,000 TCGA samples, determined by a random forest classifier trained on the pattern of somatic alterations of known drivers [14]. For example, an activating driver TF (such as MYC) is expected to be more active than normal when affected by gain-of-function mutations or amplifications, and the opposite for a LoF TF driver, such as TP53 when affected by LoF mutations or deletions. Note that this classification has no relation whatsoever with the effect of the TF on the expression its targets, a set of which may result up- or downregulated irrespective of the type of alterations suffered by the driver TF. According to this list, there are 22 Act and 36 LoF driver TFs, as well as six driver TFs with undetermined mode of action. Members of 15 TF families [11] participate in tumorigenesis in the 28 tumor types analyzed. Twelve of them are represented by more than one driver protein (Fig. 1 and Additional file 2: Table S1). The largest family of TFs (Zinc fingers C2H2) also contributes the largest share of drivers to tumorigensis in the 28 cancer types.

                        Enrichment for mutations of driver TFs across the 48 cohorts of tumors. The color scale of the cells follows the -log(P value) of Fisherâs test (see color legend at the bottom). Column color annotations from top to bottom represent the number of cohorts where the TF is identified as driver (the darker the purple, the more cohorts) and the family of the TF. The abbreviations used, and full names of families of each TF appear in Additional file 2: Table S1. Row color annotations represent the cohorts of tumors where the driver TFs were detected, with different colors symbolizing cohorts of tumor of different tumor types, the acronyms of which are detailed in the list of abbreviations. The source of mutational data of each cohort appear in Rubio-Perez et al. (20015) [10]
                      , The 64 driver TFs possess varying degrees of implication in tumorigenesis in different tumor types, as illustrated in Fig. 1 and Additional file 1: Figure S2. For instance, while TP53 is significantly enriched for mutations in ovarian, colorectal, head and neck, or lung cancers, it is mutated below expectations â set by other driver TFs â in thyhroid and prostate carcinomas, as well as in melanomas and medulloblastomas. The activity of some TFs as mutational drivers is very specific of one or few tumor types. This is the case of GATA3 in breast tumors, ZNF292 in low grade gliomas, ARID5B in uterine carcinomas, and MYC in diffuse B-cell lymphomas. Well-known driver TFs such as TP53, SMAD4, and NFE2L2 acting in 40, 15, and 11 cohorts, respectively, share the top-ranking positions with others just recently identified, like TBX3 (14 cohorts), which promotes cell migration and invasion [27], MECOM (11 cohorts), with inhibitory effects on apoptosis [28], or ARHGAP35 (11 cohorts), a GTPase-activating protein that promotes invasion and metastasis [29]., In an effort to identify the domains of each TF that are most relevant to tumorigenesis upon somatic mutations (Additional file 1: Figure S1B), I computed the relative enrichment of each domain (defined by InterPro [12]) for somatic mutations (SNVs and short indels) across the approximately 7,000 tumors in the cohort versus common variants observed in the exomes of 65,000 individuals (see Methods). In the case of somatic mutations detected across tumor samples, only those with consequence-types deemed to affect the protein sequence (that is, missense, stop-gain, stop-loss, splice-donor, splice-acceptor, frameshift) were included. In the case of the variants detected across non-cancer genomes of individuals, I included SNVs and short indels with all consequence types, but only those with allele frequency above 10â4, which ensures that they are likely to be common polymorphisms in the human population., This analysis therefore aimed to rank higher domains with the greatest differences between the accumulation of somatic mutations in tumors that signals them as subjects of positive selection and the number of common germline variants that entail their baseline tolerance to variation. I thus computed the fraction of mutations occurring in every domain of a TF out of the total number of mutations observed in the gene across tumors and, similarly their share of common germline variants. Each circle in Fig. 2a corresponds to a TF domain represented in a plane defined by these two quantities, whereas its color represents the significance of its relative enrichment for somatic mutations. All domains of TP53 (annotated at the right of panel A) accumulate a relatively low fraction of the variants observed in the gene, except the p53 tumor suppressor family, which encompasses most of the protein sequence. The fraction of mutations occurring at each domain is nevertheless significantly higher (Fig. 2b). Whereas somatic mutations impairing the activity of TP53 tend to accumulate in the DNA-binding domain and the tetramerization domain of the TF, tolerated germline variants concentrate in the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the protein, outside its most important structural and functional features. In the case of RUNX1 (Fig. 2c) somatic mutations tend to accumulate in the short stretches of sequence that define the AML1/Runt domain. Although many of the domains that appear at the top of the list of relative enrichment for somatic mutations correspond to the portions of the TF that directly bind the DNA (p53, DNA-binding domain, winged helix-turn-helix, zinc finger, homeodomain, and so on), other types of TFs domains are also tumorigenic. The latter include the aforementioned tetramerization domain of TP53 and the ligand binding domain of NR4A2, a nuclear hormone receptor (Additional file 3: Table S2).

                      , The rationale of this study â the hypothesis that driver alterations of TFs result in misregulation of their targets â assumes that driver TFs are expressed and carry out their functions in the tumor types where they are identified as drivers and where I probe this misregulation. The list of drivers employed in this study in each tumor type (and by extension the driver TFs) are known to be expressed in the tumors of the cohort where they act as drivers, because part of the process of detection of mutational drivers excludes non-expressed genes. As for their activity, driver genes are detected as such because they exhibit signals of positive selection (see references [10] and [13]) in the tumor types where they are nominated as drivers, which implies that either their over-activation (in the case of oncogenes), or their inactivation (for tumor suppressors) exists and is key to the development of tumorigenesis. (Note that in the latter case, the inactivation in tumors bearing LoF alterations presupposes that they are active in the other tumors of the cohort)., To investigate the changes in expression of genes resulting from the alteration of driver TFs (Additional file 1: Figure S1C), I first collected lists of genes under the regulation (targets) of TFs from four sources (Additional file 1: Table S3). These four online resources contain curated TF targets retrieved from the literature (HTRIdb [17], pazar [18], and TRANSFAC v. 7.4 via MSigDB [19, 20]), and the list of genes with either proximal or distal TF binding sites detected through ChIP-seq analysis by the ENCODE consortium [21]. Forty-two driver TFs were assigned targets (ranging from 1 to 5,963 with median 232; Additional file 1: Table S4) retrieved from one or more of these databases. In every tumor sample within 15 cohorts analyzed by TCGA (Additional file 1: Table S5), I then determined the alteration status of each driver TF. In this case, because the copy number status of each gene is available besides the list of somatic SNVs and short indels (hereinafter, mutations), I employed both types of alterations to define the samples where each driver TF is altered. Missense mutations and amplifications were considered driver alterations of activating driver TFs. On the other hand, driver alterations of LoF driver TFs are truncating or missense mutations or deletions (see Methods). Driver TFs with undetermined mode of action were applied the same rule as activating driver TFs. Finally, I compared the expression level of the target of each driver TF in the tumor samples bearing driver alterations with that of the samples where it was unaltered. A target was considered significantly misregulated (misregulated targets) upon driver alterations in a TF if the MannâWhitney P value of the comparison was smaller than 0.05 and the log2 of the fold-change was either smaller than â1 or greater than 1. Note that because the targets obtained from the four aforementioned sources have been detected irrespective of the tissue type and normally in healthy tissues, the differential expression analysis acts as a filter to detect those targets most likely misregulated upon alterations of driver TFs., The volcano plot in Fig. 3a illustrates the distribution of targets in a P value to fold-change plane resulting from the differential expression analysis of all driver TFs in the breast cancer cohort (BRCA), with the lines delimiting significance highlighted. Similar volcano plots and results of the analysis in other tumor types appear in Additional file 1: Figure S3 and Additional file 4: Table S6. The distribution of the expression of six misregulated BRCA targets are shown in panels (b) to (g) of Fig. 3. BIRC5 or survivin (Fig. 3b), a target of TP53 is an anti-apoptotic molecule that has been previously linked to the development and progression of breast cancer and the emergence of drug resistance, as well as with tumorigenesis in other cancer types [30â32]. S100A2, which also appears upregulated in samples bearing driver alterations of TP53 (Fig. 3c) has been related to tumor promoting processes, such as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Initially, though, to act as a tumor suppressor, it probably plays a dual role in cancerogenesis [33â35]. In both cases, truncating mutations of TP53 appear to cause larger upregulation of the targets, supporting the notion that they possess a higher driver potential, with some missense mutations actually acting as passengers. Nevertheless, the pooled analysis of the misregulation of all targets of TP53 across all tumor types reveals that although in most cases truncating mutation of the TF do affect more the expression of its targets than missense mutations, the differences are clearly significant only in breast tumors, glioblastomas, and low grade gliomas (Additional file 1: Figure S4).

Each circle represents a target gene placed in MannâWhitney -log(P value) versus log2(fold-change) coordinates. Targets of each TF are represented following the color code represented below the graph. Volcano plots for other tumor types appear in Additional file 1: Figure S3. All data presented in these figures are provided in Additional file 4: Table S6. b-g Distribution of the expression of six illustrated targets of TP53 (b, c), MYC (d, e), and GATA3 (f, g). Each boxplot in the graphs correspond to the expression of the target in samples bearing one type of driver alteration â truncating (T) and missense mutations (M), and deletions (C) in the case of TP53 and GATA3, and amplifications (C) in the case of MYC â any driver alteration (ALL), or no driver alteration (N). Boxplots are only represented for sets of at least five samples. The name of each graph is formed by a concatenation of the name of the target gene, the name of its TF, the MannâWhitney -log(P value) and the fold-change of its differential expression analysis
                      , 
                           EGR3 and HEPACAM are significantly downregulated in samples with MYC amplifications (Fig. 3d and e). The former encodes an early growth response TF related among others to lymphocyte development and endothelial cell growth and migration whose downregulation could play a role in the proliferation, metastasis, and progression of cancer cells [36, 37], whereas the latter is a likely tumor suppressor gene which codes for a protein involved in cell motility [38]. Finally, panels F and G illustrate the misregulation of TCF7L1 and DNAJC12, two significant targets of GATA3 linked to tumorigenesis. TCF7L1 encodes a TF in the WNT pathway which regulates the expression of cell cycle related genes and is a central regulator of tumor growth and initiation [39â41]; DNAJC12 is a chaperone upregulated in several cancer types., The sets of significant targets of most driver TFs differ widely between tumor types (Fig. 4a and Additional file 5: Table S7), with the notable exception of NFE2L2 and, to some extent, TP53, MYC (Fig. 4b), PAX5, and RUNX1. Nineteen genes are significantly over-expressed in samples of five tumor types driven by somatic alterations of NFE2L2. These include a set of enzymes involved in the antioxidant response promoted by this TF, such as NOQ1, AKR1B10, AKR1C1, AKR1C3, and ALDH3A1, but also the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, whose upregulation sustains the elevated production of NADPH and biosynthesis required by tumor proliferation [42]. NFE2L2 thus probably causes the shift of the cellular metabolic program to promote tumorigenesis in cancer types driven by its alterations. This implies that tumors driven by alterations of NFE2L2, regardless of their tissue of origin are much more similar to each other than tumors driven by alterations of other driver TFs.

Overlaps between sets of targets of each TF are represented following the color code shown at the bottom of the graph. The diameter of the circles is proportional to the size of the overlapping list of targets. Selected pairs of tumor types with significant overlap of targets of different driver TFs appear at the right of the graph. b Overlap of significant targets of selected TFs between pairs of tumor types where they act as drivers. Heatmaps at the left contain the Jaccardâs index of the overlap between significant targets detected in each tumor type, while heatmaps at the right represent the Fisherâs -log(q-value) of each comparison. Color scales for both magnitudes appear at the bottom of the panel. All data presented in these figures are provided in Additional file 5: Table S7
                      , The coincidence of significant targets of TP53 is also significant across several malignancies. Significant overlap occurs between the sets of targets in tumors of the central nervous system (GBM and LGG) and prostate adenocarcinomas. These include the over-expression of COL11A1, typical of mesenchyme-derived tumors with high metastatic potential [43], and the under-expression of PHLDA3, a protein with a PH domain which inhibits the activation of Akt [44]. A second group of tumor types with significant overlapping targets include bladder, breast, lung, and uterus carcinomas (Fig. 4b)., Finally, I exploited the sets of significant targets of driver TFs to find other drivers in the same tumor type causing similar downstream alterations, under the hypothesis that somatic alterations of different drivers in the same or cross-talking pathways may converge in the downstream alteration of the expression of similar groups of genes (Additional file 1: Figure S1D). To this end, I first searched for all drivers connected to each driver TF (partner drivers) in each tumor type in a network of functional interactions [22] with no more than 50 % of their altered samples overlapping with those of the TF. I then repeated the process of identifying significantly misregulated genes â within the set of targets of the TF â between the group of tumor samples bearing driver alterations of the partner and the tumors where neither the partner nor the driver TF were altered. Next, I computed the significance of the overlap between the set of upregulated genes upon driver alteration of the TF and the set of upregulated genes upon driver alteration of the partner, and the same for the sets of downregulated genes. I used the two corrected P values of the overlaps between upregulated and downregulated sets of genes as a proxy of the strength of the tumorigenic link between the TF and the partner in tumorigenesis. I call these connections TF-partner âdriver circuitsâ â driver circuits in this paper, for simplicity â and understand them as common pathways towards tumorigenesis, with driver alterations of their two members resulting in convergent misregulation of the same cellular processes., 
                           TP53 and MYC possess the highest number of significant partners (overlap upregulation or downregulation q-values <10â3), with 26 and 25, respectively (Fig. 5a, Additional file 6: Table S8). Circuits involving them clearly dominate tumorigenesis in breast (16 and 12) and uterus carcinomas (12 and 5). One of the most significant partnerships of MYC in both breast and uterus cancer cells involves ERBB2, whose effect on the over-expression of the TF in HER2+ breast tumors [45, 46] has been noted before. The results shown here (Fig. 5b) suggest that this connection is also very prominent in tumors of the uterus. The circuit formed by MYC and the pair CDKN2A/CDKN2B also appears very significant in breast tumors (Fig. 5c), in coherence with the role that MYC amplification has on the enhancement of cell cycle de-regulation [47, 48]. Other very significant â and not so well known â partners of MYC in breast and uterus carcinomas include NDRG1, whose deficiency induces the epithelial-mesenchymal transition [49], CARM1, a methyltransferase known to methylate NOTCH1 [50], DDX5, a key mediator in the inhibition of ribosomal biogenesis by CDKN2A [51], and ZFP36L1, a regulator of apoptosis [52]. Outside these two malignancies, MYC appears strongly connected to STK11 in lung adenocarcinomas (Fig. 5d), a kinase related with global regulation of cell metabolism [53] among other processes. On the other hand, the list of TP53 partners in four cancer types, as expected, is populated mainly by genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle and DNA damage detection and repair, such as CCNE1, MDM2, MDM4, BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM, and ATR.

The diameter of each circle is proportional to the average size of the overlapping upregulated targets and downregulated targets. The colors of circuits follow the code of their respective TF shown at the bottom of the graph. All data presented in this graph are provided in Additional file 6: Table S8. b-e Examples of the misregulation of targets caused by partner-TF circuits in uterus (b), breast (c), lung (d), and head and neck (e) carcinomas. In each heatmap, target genes are represented as rows and tumor samples are represented as columns. Cells represent the mean-centered values of expression of each target in each tumor sample (color scale below panel a). Upregulated targets appear at the top of the heatmap (purple block), while downregulated targets appear at the bottom (blue block). The uppermost layer of annotations above the columns of the heatmaps signal samples bearing driver mutations of the TF (top row) and the partner (bottom row). The second layer of annotations present the collective degree of alteration of upregulated (top row) and downregulated (bottom row) targets in each tumor samples, determined as the Zscore of the Sample Level Enrichment Analysis (SLEA) of both sets of targets (color scale below panel a). Samples in the heatmap are sorted following the mutual exclusivity pattern of driver alterations in the TF and the partner
                      , Driver alterations of KEAP1 in LUSC tumors result in the upregulation of the expression of a set of genes that very significantly (q-valueâ=â1.42âÃâ10â26) overlap the upregulated targets of NFE2L2 (Fig. 5e), corroborating that LoF mutations in the former cause tumorigenesis in lung squamous cells through the same pathway as gain-of-function mutations or amplifications of the latter. The disruption of this partnership involving the ubiquitination of NFE2L2 through the KEAP1/CUL3/RBX1 complex and its posterior proteasomal degradation, which leads to the constitutive activation of antioxidant response genes is known in several cancer types [54â56]. While the partnership in tumorigenesis of driver alterations of KEAP1 and NFE2L2 appears very prominent in LUSC tumors, CUL3 seems a more outstanding partner in head and neck squamous carcinomas (Fig. 5a, Additional file 6: Table S8)., This work presents the first systematic characterization of the repertoire of mutational driver transcription factors in 28 human malignancies, as well as the collection of their targets most likely involved in tumorigenesis in 15 of these cancer types. Furthermore, exploiting the misregulation of the sets of significant targets of driver TFs, it highlights a set of connections with other driver genes, thus shedding light onto the mechanisms of tumorigenesis that underlie their alterations. Additional file 1: Figure S1 summarizes all the analyses carried out as part of this study., There are caveats to both the detection of driver TFs and their targets involved in tumoriegensis and to the identification of driver circuits. The recognized incompleteness of the list of human TFs [11] and the catalog of driver genes â due to limitations built in the limit of detection of current methods [10, 13] â produces a repertoire of driver TFs that is not complete. Nevertheless, probably the predominant TFs involved in carcinogenesis upon somatic mutations in the tumor types studied are included within it. The shortcoming is more acute when it comes to the collection of target genes employed in the study. Although resulting from the combination of several databases exploiting different criteria to identify the targets of TFs, it is far from complete. (See further assessment of shortcomings in the detection of misregulated targets of driver TFs in Additional file 1: Tables S9 and S10.) In addition, note that the detection of differentially expressed targets of a TF is done previously to the detection of its partners and thus the set of samples bearing no driver mutations may actually include samples where a connected driver bears a mutation that result in the misregulation of the TF targets. As a result, the significance of the MannâWhitney test comparing the expression of targets in both sets of samples may be diminished, causing the loss of some significant targets. False positive target genes, or targets not involved in tumorigenesis, may have also been included in the collection. Finally, the detection of drivers connected to TFs in the development of tumorigenesis is limited by the current extent of functional interaction networks., Despite these limitations, the aforementioned outcomes of this work are relevant for the oncogenomics research community. Although previous works have identified cliques of drivers altered in a mutually exclusive manner across tumor samples [7, 8] â under the same rationale that this pattern signals convergent roads to tumorigenesis â no study to date has directly tested the hypothesis that alterations in connected drivers actually result in the misregulation of similar sets of targets. When the TFs and partners forming potential driver circuits probed in this study (with at least one significantly misregulated target gene shared by both the TF and its partner) are analyzed for mutual exclusivity of their pattern of alterations, only few of them reveal significant (See further details in Additional file 7: Table S11.) This is probably because the detection of potential downstream relationships between pairs of driver genes relying on the mutual exclusivity of their alterations is limited by the statistical power one can achieved from the frequency of somatic alterations. This limitation is probably less severe when such relationships are explored through the misregulation of downstream target genes. This highlights the interest of developing a bioinformatics method that exploits the overlap of misregulated target genes between pairs (or among groups) of drivers to reconstruct such relationships., Besides the interest that the circuits of drivers detected in 15 different malignancies (Additional file 6: Table S8) may have for basic research dedicated to the emergence and evolution of cancer, they also have possible implications in the framework of pre-clinical research. It is reasonable to expect that tumors bearing alterations in driver genes connected in a circuit will follow similar evolution patterns, resulting in similar outcomes and exhibit similar response to a given therapeutic strategy. These circuits may thus represent a way of choosing therapies to indirectly target driver alterations in a tumor [10]. It is possible to envisage that this strategy to detect circuits of connected driver genes may be extended beyond this work focused on driver TFs, once more data on the functional consequences of LoF or activation of drivers â similar to the oncogenic signatures of MSigDB â become available., In addition, the sets of significant targets of the driver TFs in the 15 tumor types studied here (Additional file 4: Table S6) constitute a source of data to formulate and test hypotheses on the tumorigenic process underlying them. As with the list of circuits, they have possible application to clinically-oriented research. The rationale in this case is that the accuracy of predictions on the outcome of tumors and their response to drugs could improve if the alteration status of significant targets is considered in addition to the status of driver TFs or their partners. With respect to the overlaps between the sets of significant targets of a TF in different tumor types, one can imagine the development of an âindex of similarityâ between tumor types of different origin driven by alterations of the same gene, based on the overlap of their oncogenic signatures. This index could then be applied to predict the likelihood of success of repositioning a therapeutic strategy developed and tested on one tumor type [10] to another., The detection of overlapping sets of misregulated genes downstream pairs of drivers, or convergent misregulated targets allows to identify driver circuits, which is demonstrated as a proof of concept in this work. These driver circuits may provide clues to choosing therapies to indirectly target driver alterations in a tumor., Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, LAML, Acute myeloid leukemia, Bladder adenocarcinoma, Breast adenocarcinoma, Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Colorectal adenocarcinoma, chromatin regulatory factor, Difuse large B-cell lymphoma, Esophageal carcinoma, Glioblastoma multiforme, Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, Renal clear cell carcinoma, Low grade glioma, Liver hepatocellular carcinoma, Lung adenocarcinoma, Lung squamous cell carcinoma, Medulloblastoma, Multiple myeloma, Neuroblastoma, Non-small cell lung cancer, Ovarian cystadenocarcinoma, Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, Prostate adenocarcinoma, Small cell lung cancer, Skin cutaneous melanoma, Stomach adenocarcinoma, Transcription factor, Thyroid adenocarcinoma, Uterus endometrioid carcinoma,

                Background
                AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease affects ~13 % of people in the United States 65 years and older, making it the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Recent work has identified roles for environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors in AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease risk.
              
                Methods
                We performed a genome-wide screen of DNA methylation using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 platform on bulk tissue samples from the superior temporal gyrus of patients with AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease and non-demented controls. We paired a sliding window approach with multivariate linear regression to characterize AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs).
              
                Results
                We identified 479 DMRs exhibiting a strong bias for hypermethylated changes, a subset of which were independently associated with aging. DMR intervals overlapped 475 RefSeq genes enriched for gene ontology categories with relevant roles in neuron function and development, as well as cellular metabolism, and included genes reported in AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease genome-wide and epigenome-wide association studies. DMRs were enriched for brain-specific histone signatures and for binding motifs of transcription factors with roles in the brain and AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease pathology. Notably, hypermethylated DMRs preferentially overlapped poised promoter regions, marked by H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, previously shown to co-localize with aging-associated hypermethylation. Finally, the integration of DMR-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms with AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease genome-wide association study risk loci and brain expression quantitative trait loci highlights multiple potential DMRs of interest for further functional analysis.
              
                Conclusion
                We have characterized changes in DNA methylation in the superior temporal gyrus of patients with AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease, highlighting novel loci that facilitate better characterization of pathways and mechanisms underlying AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs disease pathogenesis, and improve our understanding of epigenetic signatures that may contribute to the development of disease.

Diagnosis of AD is based on the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques [2], and symptoms typically include memory loss and impaired cognitive ability. Although the pathological hallmarks associated with dementia-related symptoms in AD appear largely similar between both the early-onset and late-onset forms of the disease, their underlying etiologies contrast [3]. Whereas early-onset AD is a familial autosomal dominant disorder caused by rare, highly penetrant mutations in one of a small set of genes (APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2), the more common late-onset form of the disease (accounting for 90Ã¢ÂÂ95 % of cases) occurs sporadically, and risk is determined by complex underlying mechanisms [3Ã¢ÂÂ6]. Estimates based on twin concordance rates suggest heritability of late-onset AD is as high as 70 %, implicating major roles for genetic as well as non-genetic factors [6]. Indeed, through candidate gene studies, as well as more recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and whole-exome sequencing, both common and rare variants associated with the late-onset form of AD have been identified [7Ã¢ÂÂ11]. Collectively, however, common GWAS variants account for only a modest proportion (~30 %) of the underlying variance in disease susceptibility [12]. Several environmental factors are also thought to play a role [5, 6], yet exactly how these contribute to risk, onset, and progression remains poorly defined., Recently, there has been increasing interest in the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the interaction between the genome and environment in human diseases [13, 14], including AD [15, 16]. Epigenetic alterations can be defined as modifications to DNA that impact gene expression and phenotype without a change in the nucleotide sequence. These changes can arise within cells of an individual and be maintained through mitosis [17], as well as passed from parent to offspring meiotically [18]. One of the best-studied epigenetic modifications involves changes in DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides. The establishment of DNA methylation is essential for normal cell development and differentiation [19], and impacts many key cellular processes, including gene regulation [20], X chromosome inactivation [21, 22], and genomic imprinting [23]. The application of genome-wide methylation profiling techniques has led to a rapid increase in the characterization of methylation patterns across the genome, and has facilitated the identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with evolutionary processes [24], human aging [25Ã¢ÂÂ29], cancer [30, 31], and complex disease [32Ã¢ÂÂ35]., Several lines of evidence point to the influence of DNA methylation in AD pathogenesis [15], including direct connections between AD and DNA methylation that have been observed both globally and at specific loci. For example, differences in tissue-wide methylation patterns in disease-relevant brain regions have been reported in patients with AD compared to controls, as well as in monozygotic twins discordant for AD [36, 37]. Locus-specific examples from targeted gene studies also demonstrate a role for DNA methylation changes in AD and include observed disease-associated differences at ribosomal RNA gene promoters [38], genome-wide LINE-1 elements [39], and known AD susceptibility genes [40]. More recently, three epigenome-wide studies (EWAS) have been conducted in AD, collectively generating DNA methylation profiles from three different brain regions of patients with AD [41Ã¢ÂÂ43], observing both cross-tissue and tissue-specific effects. Importantly, each of these studies discovered differentially methylated CpGs outside of well-established AD genetic risk loci, highlighting the potential utility of EWAS in the characterization of novel genes and pathways underlying disease processes., In the present study, we have used the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 array platform to conduct a genome-wide screen of DNA methylation in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) of 34 patients with AD and 34 controls, a brain region recently demonstrated to be a site of significant AD-associated gene dysregulation [44]. Building on previous EWAS in AD, which have primarily focused on single CpG analysis, we applied our recently developed pipeline that aims to identify DMRs harboring multiple statistically significant CpGs exhibiting concordant disease-associated changes in methylation [32]. Using this approach we have identified novel and robust DMRs associated with >400 coding transcripts, many of which have known roles in brain function and AD pathology. Additionally, we show that identified DMRs co-localize with other functional epigenetic signatures in brain tissues, overlap with risk loci identified in AD GWASs and previous EWASs, and harbor expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) associated with changes in brain gene expression., Tissue samples from the STG of 34 patients with confirmed late-onset AD and 34 non-demented controls matched by age of death (AOD), race, and gender were obtained from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (www.Ã¢ÂÂmssm.Ã¢ÂÂedu/Ã¢ÂÂresearch/Ã¢ÂÂlabs/Ã¢ÂÂneuropathology-and-brain-banking). Each donor had previously undergone a battery of pathological evaluations, and diagnosis of AD was based on both clinical and neuropathological criteria [44] (Additional file 1: Table S1). Patients with AD had a mean clinical dementia rating of 3.3, a Braak Stage score average of 5.7 (see [44] for staging classification), a mean cortical plaque density of 19.8 based on measurements from five cortical brain regions [44], and a mean AOD of 79.1 years (range, 66Ã¢ÂÂ92 years). Controls were determined to have negligible cortical plaque densities (mean, 0.64), and either no evidence of or only mild clinical symptoms of dementia (mean clinical dementia rating, 0.87; mean Braak Stage score, 1.4), with a mean AOD of 80.5 years (range, 66Ã¢ÂÂ95 years). Diagnostic and dementia assessment consent procedures were approved by the institutional review boards of Mount Sinai Medical Center, Jewish Home and Hospital, and the JJ Peters VA Medical Center. Consents for brain donation were obtained in writing from the legal next of kin of all donors., Tissue dissections and sample preparations were carried out following previously published protocols (see [44Ã¢ÂÂ47]). Briefly, following dissections, samples were subjected to proteinase K digestion and treatment with RNAse A. Genomic DNA was then isolated using standard phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation methods., One microgram of DNA from each sample was sodium bisulfate-treated using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) and processed for analysis on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) array platform at the Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine genomics core facility (New York, NY, USA). Subjects were distributed across six BeadChips (12 samples/array) taking into account AOD, gender, race, and caseÃ¢ÂÂcontrol status to mitigate anomalies resulting from potential batch effects. The GenomeStudio Methylation Module Package (version 1.9, Illumina) was used for initial data processing, allowing for the calculation of methylation values (expressed as ÃÂ²-values, ranging from 0 to 1) and detection P-values for 482,421 individual probes spanning the 22 autosomes and sex chromosomes. Owing to differences in sex chromosome number between males and females, and the fact that our cohort was of mixed gender, only autosomal loci were considered here., Before proceeding to statistical analysis, data were processed further following the pipeline developed by Huynh et al. [32]. Probes meeting the following criteria known to impact array performance were excluded: (1) those mapping to more than one position in the human reference genome (build NCBI36; hg18) using BSMAP [48], allowing a maximum of two mismatches and three gaps; and (2) those probes for which a 1000 Genomes Project [49, 50] single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; minor allele frequencyÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ¥Ã¢ÂÂ0.05) mapped to within 5 base pairs (bp) of the probe-targeted CpG. In addition, on a per sample basis, individual ÃÂ²-values for a given CpG were not considered if their detection P-value wasÃ¢ÂÂ>Ã¢ÂÂ0.01. Data for the 461,272 remaining autosomal CpGs passing our exclusion criteria in the 68 individuals were color and background adjusted, and quantile normalized using lumi and methylumi, implemented in R [51, 52] (www.Ã¢ÂÂR-project.Ã¢ÂÂorg). The Beta Mixture Quantile Method, as implemented in BMIQ version 1.3 [53], was also applied to the data to correct Infinium I/II probe type bias. Plots from principal component analysis using autosomal methylation profiles from the 68 samples did not reveal major batch effects or anomalous samples. Raw and processed data for all samples have been deposited in GEO under accession GSE76105., We first employed linear regression to delineate disease-specific effects on methylation between cases and controls at each of the 461,272 autosomal CpGs. Linear models were developed to account for various independent variables in addition to disease status, including AOD, gender, race, array/batch, and neuronal/glial cell composition. Post-mortem interval was not included in the test model because there was no significant difference observed between cases and controls (t-test, PÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ0.881). Cell proportions were estimated from our bulk tissue samples using the CETS R package, developed from 450 K array profiles of sorted neuronal and glial cell subsets from 59 adult individuals [54]. When evaluating results of linear regression, neuronal proportion (NP) was considered only for 154,874 CpGs previously reported to be differentially methylated between the two cell types [54]. For these CpGs, we used the following model: ÃÂ²Ã¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂAODÃ¢ÂÂ+Ã¢ÂÂgenderÃ¢ÂÂ+Ã¢ÂÂraceÃ¢ÂÂ+Ã¢ÂÂarrayÃ¢ÂÂ+Ã¢ÂÂNPÃ¢ÂÂ+Ã¢ÂÂdisease status. For all remaining CpGs, NP was not included in the model. CpGs exhibiting average increases in methylation within the AD group as compared to controls (based on regression coefficients associated with disease status) were defined as hypermethylated (hyper) and those exhibiting decreases as hypomethylated (hypo)., Significant CpGs were clustered into DMRs using a 1 kilobase (kb) sliding window, modified from the genome-tiling method described by Bock [55], and previously developed and implemented by Huynh et al. [32]; a window size of 1 kb was previously shown to be optimal for Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 array data based on correlations between methylation levels of closely neighboring CpGs [32]. FisherÃ¢ÂÂs method was used to combine one-sided regression P-values across neighboring CpGs within a given 1 kb window, while taking into account methylation state (i.e., hyper vs. hypo). The positions of CpGs on either end of a significant window demarcated the coordinates of each DMR. Combined P-values for each window/DMR were corrected using the BenjaminiÃ¢ÂÂHochberg method for false discovery rate (FDR) [56]; DMRs meeting a 1 % FDR cutoff were used for downstream analyses., Probes/CpGs were annotated based on their overlap with specific genomic features using BedTools version 2.1 [57]. Features included functional RefSeq (hg18) genes and promoters (defined asÃ¢ÂÂÃÂ±Ã¢ÂÂ2 kb from the transcriptional start site, TSS), where CpGs were considered to be intergenic if they overlapped neither gene bodies nor promoters; CpG islands (CpGi; UCSC/hg18 annotation), shores (ÃÂ±2 kb from CpGi), shelves (ÃÂ±2 kb from CpG shores), and sea (not within islands, shores, or shelves); and DNaseI hypersensitivity sites and histone marks (H3K9ac, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3) in various human brain datasets generated as part of the ENCODE and REMC projects and curated as described previously [58, 59]., DMR enrichments in specific gene-related and CpGi-related features were tested using the ÃÂ-square test, by comparing the proportions of DMR-CpGs within the genomic features to the overlap of these features with a background list of 461,272 autosomal CpGs from the 450 K array. For instances in which DMRs overlapped both a promoter and gene body, the promoter annotation was given precedent. The enrichment of DMRs overlapping ENCODE and REMC datasets was tested using INRICH [60]; DMRs (hyper and hypo were considered separately) were used as test regions, the curated histone marks were used as target regions, and again the background set of 450 K CpGs was used as the map file. INRICH estimates if the DMRs overlap curated histone marks more than expected by chance; DMRs were permuted within the genome but matched to the associated DMRs in terms of the number of DMR sites and the number of overlapping histone marks. Empirical P-values were estimated based on 10,000 permutations., RefSeq gene promoters (ÃÂ±2 kb TSSs) overlapped by DMRs were assessed for potential enrichments of defined transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) characterized in human lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs; nÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ282 TFBS motifs), and a human medulloblastoma cell line (nÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ258 TFBS motifs). Specifically, we used LCL TFBS reported by Pique-Regi et al. [61] characterized using the CENTIPEDE algorithm, after removing binding motifs lacking specifically assigned TFs; medulloblastoma TFBSs were defined as sites where evolutionarily conserved binding motifs of human/mouse/rat TFs overlapped regions of open chromatin based on DNaseI/formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements/chromatin immunoprecipitation synthesis [58, 62]. The UCSC tracks used to compile the medulloblastoma dataset were found at http://Ã¢ÂÂgenome.Ã¢ÂÂucsc.Ã¢ÂÂedu/Ã¢ÂÂcgi-bin/Ã¢ÂÂhgFileUi?Ã¢ÂÂdb=Ã¢ÂÂhg19&Ã¢ÂÂg=Ã¢ÂÂwgEncodeOpenChroÃ¢ÂÂmSynth and http://Ã¢ÂÂhgdownload.Ã¢ÂÂcse.Ã¢ÂÂucsc.Ã¢ÂÂedu/Ã¢ÂÂgoldenPath/Ã¢ÂÂhg19/Ã¢ÂÂdatabase/Ã¢ÂÂtfbsConsSites. Enrichments were calculated by comparing the counts of TFBSs within our set of DMR-associated promoters to the number of counts occurring in a background list of all RefSeq promoters overlapped by all sampled 450 K probes. The significance of enrichments was assessed using FisherÃ¢ÂÂs exact test (P-values were Bonferonni corrected, with a threshold set to PÃ¢ÂÂ<Ã¢ÂÂ0.01), including only motifs found in at least 5 % of the 276 tested DMR-associated gene promoters. Gene ontology (GO) enrichments for DMR-associated genes were assessed using GOrilla [63]., The GWAS SNPs used were downloaded from the NHGRI GWAS Catalog [64], using entries under Ã¢ÂÂAlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs DiseaseÃ¢ÂÂ (access date: December 2014), including SNPs recently reported in a large meta-analysis [11]; only SNPs with P-valuesÃ¢ÂÂ<Ã¢ÂÂ10Ã¢ÂÂ6 were considered. To generate brain eQTLs, we used the gene expression and genotyping datasets Braincloud [65] [GEO accession number: GSE30272], NIA/NIH [66] [GEO accession number: GSE15745], Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center [67] [GEO accession number: GSE44772], and UK Brain Expression Consortium [68] [GEO accession number: GSE46706]. Brain eQTLs were determined using methods published previously [69]. To detect the overlap among the index GWAS AD SNPs and eQTLs we used the regulatory trait concordance (RTC) approach [70, 71]. The RTC method detects the overlap of disease-associated variants with functional SNPs, accounting for the correlation structure in the genome (i.e., linkage disequilibrium, LD). RTC scores range from 0 to 1, with values Ã¢ÂÂ¥0.9 indicating likely causal regulatory effects, as demonstrated previously [70, 71]. For downstream analysis described here we consider pairs of AD GWAS SNPÃ¢ÂÂeQTLs with RTC Ã¢ÂÂ¥0.9. The enrichment analysis of DMRs with AD-associated eQTLs was conducted using the GoShifter package (https://Ã¢ÂÂwww.Ã¢ÂÂbroadinstitute.Ã¢ÂÂorg/Ã¢ÂÂmpg/Ã¢ÂÂgoshifter/Ã¢ÂÂ). GoShifter estimates the significance of overlap between trait-associated variants (AD-associated eQTLs) and epigenome annotations (DMRs), by generating null distributions of randomly shifting annotations locally within a tested region. For this analysis we used 10,000 permutations., Primers for locus-specific Sequenom MassARRAY EpiTYPER (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA) assays were designed using the EpiDesigner primer design software (http://Ã¢ÂÂwww.Ã¢ÂÂepidesigner.Ã¢ÂÂcom/Ã¢ÂÂstart3.Ã¢ÂÂhtml). The same bisulfite-converted DNA samples used for array analysis were used for EpiTYPER PCR amplification following manufacturerÃ¢ÂÂs specifications, and post-PCR sample processing and imaging were carried out at the Einstein College of Medicine Genomics Core (New York, NY, USA). ÃÂ²-values generated by the two technologies were compared using the PearsonÃ¢ÂÂs correlation coefficient (r)., Although many brain regions are affected throughout the progression of AD, an extensive study of gene expression changes associated with late-onset AD severity across 15 brain regions recently found the STG to be a site of significant gene dysregulation [44], motivating our focus on this specific region in the present study. We conducted genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation in STG bulk tissue samples from 34 patients with AD and 34 non-demented controls. Quality control processing (see Ã¢ÂÂMethodsÃ¢ÂÂ) ultimately resulted in high-quality methylation data for 461,272 autosomal CpGs in each of the 68 individuals for differential methylation analysis. Before proceeding to tests for differential methylation, we tested the reproducibility of our 450 K array data by assessing the extent of technical variation at CpGs within five genomic regions using independent locus-specific EpiTYPER PCR-based assays in 30Ã¢ÂÂ55 individuals from our cohort. Methylation estimates for the six CpGs tested on both platforms were significantly correlated between the two technologies (PÃ¢ÂÂ<Ã¢ÂÂ0.005; Additional file 2: Table S2)., Recent studies of genome-wide DNA methylation have revealed considerable effects of age [25Ã¢ÂÂ29], gender [72], ethnicity [73], and cellular composition [19, 54, 74, 75]. Although our disease and control samples were relatively well matched for AOD, gender, and ethnicity, our estimations of neuronal versus glial cell proportions revealed a smaller proportion of neuronal cells in our AD samples (AD meanÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ0.247; Control meanÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ0.303; t-test, PÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ0.00099; Additional file 3: Figure S1). This is consistent with histological studies reporting neuronal loss in the brains of patients with AD [76]. Thus, we used multivariate linear regression to delineate significant AD-associated effects on DNA methylation while accounting for potential effects of these variables. It is worth noting that when we repeated our analysis without considering neuronal proportions using a t-test (data not shown), we found that a large fraction of the CpGs that were significantly associated with AD (~62 %) were also found to have significant differences in methylation (>5 %) between neuronal and glial cells [54], demonstrating the importance of incorporating cell composition information into methylation studies in DNA extracted from bulk tissue., We first compared results from our linear regression analysis to the top 100 CpGs recently reported from an EWAS conducted in STG tissue in a separate cohort of patients with AD and controls [42]. Of the 96 CpGs also screened in our study, 22 (22.9 %) were found to be differentially methylated with the same directional change in patients with AD in our cohort (PÃ¢ÂÂ<Ã¢ÂÂ0.05, one-tailed). We also assessed the degree of methylation differences associated with disease in our samples compared to the Lunnon et al. [42] cohort for these same 96 CpGs, and observed a significant correlation between the two datasets (rÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ0.34; PÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ0.00067; Additional file 4: Figure S2). The extent of replication observed between our two cohorts is comparable to that initially reported by Lunnon et al. [42] between their samples and other independent cohorts. The incomplete overlap across studies is to be expected given the smaller sample sizes studied to date. Analogous to what has been observed in genetic studies such as GWAS, with increases in cohort sizes, we should expect to see stronger and broader reproducibility of EWAS results., To increase power in EWAS using smaller disease cohorts, several methods have recently been developed to extend beyond single CpG analysis by leveraging concordant statistical signals from neighboring CpGs to identify DMRs [55, 77]. For our primary analysis, we paired linear regression with a 1 kb sliding window method [32] to search for regions of the genome containing clusters of CpGs exhibiting similar changes in methylation with disease, limiting the likelihood of identifying false positives and allowing for the identification of more robust DMRs. The distribution of all tested autosomal CpGs and DMR-associated FisherÃ¢ÂÂs P-values (FDR-corrected) are displayed in Fig. 1a. Based on a 1 % FDR cutoff, we identified 479 DMRs, with an average size of 927 bp (Additional file 5: Figure S3A). In total, these DMRs included 4,565 CpGs, 48 % of which were independently significant based on linear regression (PÃ¢ÂÂ<Ã¢ÂÂ0.05, one-tailed), with an average of 4.63 significant CpGs per DMR (minÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ1, maxÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ24; Additional file 5: Figure S3B). Summary data and annotation for all DMR-CpGs are provided in Additional file 6: Table S3.

                      , Globally, population-wide (AD and controls) ÃÂ²-value averages across all 461,272 autosomal CpGs showed a bimodal distribution (Fig. 1b), with the majority of values falling either below 0.2 or above 0.8. The DMRs identified in our study were strongly biased toward hypermethylated changes (increased in AD; hyper-DMRsÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ321, hypo-DMRsÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ158; Fig. 1c). Given that AD is linked to aging, it is interesting that CpG DNA methylation has also been shown to increase with age in multiple studies of the human brain [25, 28]. Significant AD-associated CpG methylation was also recently reported to independently correlate with age [41]. We further investigated potential links between AD-DMR CpGs and aging in our dataset by assessing the effects of sample AOD on methylation at the top significant CpG within each DMR (hyper, nÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ321; hypo, nÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ158) in control samples (nÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ34; agesÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ66Ã¢ÂÂ95), again using multivariate linear regression to account for effects of gender, ethnicity, array/batch, and neuronal/glial proportions. Of the hypermethylated DMR-CpGs, ~21.8 % were significantly associated with AOD (PÃ¢ÂÂ<Ã¢ÂÂ0.05), compared to only ~12 % of hypomethylated DMR-CpGs (Additional file 7: Figure S4A). The degree of significance (Ã¢ÂÂlog10P-value) and absolute estimated regression coefficients were also higher on average for hypermethylated DMR-CpGs (Additional file 7: Figure S4B)., Similar to recent reports in AD and other complex diseases [32Ã¢ÂÂ35, 41Ã¢ÂÂ43], excluding cancer, the average effect of disease state on CpG methylation was modest (Fig. 1c), with an average absolute ÃÂ²-value change of 0.021 at significant CpGs within DMRs. When only the top CpG per DMR with respect to ÃÂ²-value change was considered, this mean difference increased slightly to 0.03. Importantly, however, even modest differences in methylation have been shown to associate with significant alterations in gene expression [32, 34, 41Ã¢ÂÂ43]., Nonetheless, despite modest methylation differences, we observed consistent changes amongst neighboring CpGs within DMRs. For example, genomic regions for two DMRs are plotted in Fig. 2, illustrating consistent AD versus control group differences across each locus. The 25 most significant DMRs by FDR-corrected P-value and associated data are shown in Table 1, including the physical relationship of each DMR to RefSeq gene annotations. Eight of the genes overlapped by these top 25 DMRs (LOC100507547, PPT2, PPT2-EGFL8, PRDM16, PRRT1, C10orf105, CDH23, and RNF39) were also among genes recently reported to be associated with the most significantly differentially methylated CpGs in one or more of three brain regions (entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, or STG) in patients with AD [42, 43].

                                    DMR differentially methylated region
                    , In total, we found that ~92 % of DMR-CpGs directly overlapped RefSeq gene transcript coordinates. However, their distribution within different gene features depended on methylation state. For example, compared to the distribution of all 450 K array CpGs, CpGs within hyper-DMRs were more commonly found in gene promoters (ÃÂ±2 kb TSSs), whereas CpGs in hypo-DMRs were enriched in the gene body of RefSeq transcripts (Fig. 3a). CpGs in hyper-DMRs also showed preferential overlap with CpGiÃ¢ÂÂs (Fig. 3b).

                      , The top DMR in our dataset (Table 1) overlapped the RNA helicase gene MOV10L1. Although little is known about the specific function of this gene in the brain, many other genes associated with top DMRs have reported roles in brain function, such as RNF39, KLK7, DUSP6, NAV2, and NRG2. In the context of AD pathology, the protein KLK7 (Fig. 2b; Table 1) was recently shown to cleave and degrade ÃÂ²-amyloid (AÃÂ²) and mitigate AÃÂ²-mediated toxicity in vitro [78], possibly consistent with the observed negative correlation between KLK7 expression and AD disease severity [79]. DUSP6 was recently shown to be a target of the AD-associated microRNA miR-125b, exhibiting decreased expression in AD brains; notably, knockdown of DUSP6 in primary hippocampal neurons lead to a significant increase in tau protein hyperphosphorylation, a key hallmark of AD [80]., It is also interesting that several of the top DMR-associated genes are involved in adiposity, fat distribution, and the synthesis and metabolism of cholesterol and lipids (PRDM16, TBX15, ELOVL1, and AGPAT1) [81, 82]. GO enrichments in categories related to cholesterol/lipid metabolism are among the highest observed for AD risk genes identified by GWAS [83]; alterations in the expression of related genes have been observed previously in the same cohort studied here [84Ã¢ÂÂ86]. Experimental data also highlight the potential importance of genes involved in these processes in AD pathology, with alterations in lipid and cholesterol levels having been observed in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and brains of patients with AD [87, 88], and associated with cognitive performance [89]. Furthermore, at the molecular level, both cholesterol and lipids have important roles in modulating the production and aggregation of AÃÂ² via interactions with well-known mediators of AD pathogenesis and risk, such as APP, APOE, PSEN1, and BACE1 [90, 91]., To more broadly explore the potential function of genes overlapped by AD-associated DMRs, we conducted GO analysis using a list of 475 RefSeq genes containing DMRs within their promoters and/or gene bodies. After FDR correction (qÃ¢ÂÂ<Ã¢ÂÂ0.2) and the removal of terms associated with five or fewer genes, compared to a background list of RefSeq genes overlapped by CpGs found on the 450 K array, DMR-associated genes were enriched for 30 GO terms linked to biological processes, three GO terms linked to cellular components, and four GO terms linked to molecular function (Fig. 4a; Additional file 8: Table S4). Significant GO terms included Ã¢ÂÂregulation of neuron differentiationÃ¢ÂÂ (PÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ2.93Ã¢ÂÂÃÂÃ¢ÂÂ10Ã¢ÂÂ5, enrichmentÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ2.39), Ã¢ÂÂaxonogenesisÃ¢ÂÂ (PÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ1.58Ã¢ÂÂÃÂÃ¢ÂÂ10Ã¢ÂÂ4, enrichmentÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ4.12), and Ã¢ÂÂregulation of neurogenesisÃ¢ÂÂ (PÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ8.53Ã¢ÂÂÃÂÃ¢ÂÂ10Ã¢ÂÂ5, enrichmentÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ2.13), associated with biological processes that point to roles of DMR-genes in the development of neurons and other cells in the nervous system. In addition, as noted for several genes in the top DMR list, multiple ontology terms associated with cellular metabolism were also enriched for DMR-associated genes (Fig. 4a; Additional file 8: Table S4).

                      , We next assessed the association of our DMRs with functional genome-wide datasets generated in non-diseased brain tissue/cell lines. During development and cellular differentiation, DNA methylation is known to act in concert with chromatin alterations such as histone methylation and acetylation to modify gene expression programs [92]. Furthermore, the occurrence of histone modifications can illuminate genomic regions with functional properties in the context of disease [69]. Thus, to explore whether our DMRs overlapped functional regions relevant to the human brain, we tested for enrichment of AD DMRs in regions with repressive and permissive histone modification profiles (H3K9ac, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3) generated from fetal and adult bulk brain tissue, as well as iPS-derived neurons (Fig. 4b; Additional file 9: Table S5). We found significant enrichments for hyper DMRs in poised promoters (corrected PÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ0.001), also referred to as bivalent domains, characterized by the occupancy of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3. Bivalent domains are generally thought to take on repressed states, while remaining Ã¢ÂÂpoisedÃ¢ÂÂ for activation, and these regions are known to have important roles in cell development and pluripotency [93]. It is interesting to note that, although CpGs within poised promoters are typically characterized by hypomethylation, increased DNA hypermethylation associated with human aging has been shown to occur preferentially in bivalent domains in various tissues, including the brain [26, 29, 94]; such changes have also been noted in cancer and cell culture, and may suggest that hypermethylation of bivalent domains results in a reduction of cell pluripotency [95, 96]. Given the strong connection between AD and aging, the overlap observed here between DMRs and poised promoters could have important implications for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying disease onset and progression., DNA methylation is also known to play complex roles in TF binding, in some cases either hindering or facilitating interactions between DNA motifs and proteins [97]. Thus, we tested for enrichment in AD-DMR-associated RefSeq gene promoters (nÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ276) of TFBS from two independent datasets, one curated from LCLs, and a second brain dataset consisting of evolutionarily conserved TFBSs residing within regions of open chromatin (active) in a medulloblastoma cell line (see Ã¢ÂÂMethodsÃ¢ÂÂ). After applying a multiple-testing correction and stringent filter (Bonferroni PÃ¢ÂÂ<Ã¢ÂÂ0.01), we noted 29 and 28 significant TF motif enrichments for the medulloblastoma and LCL datasets, respectively (Fig. 4c). The strongest enrichments were found for motifs of NFAT in the medulloblastoma dataset (fold-enrichmentÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ3.45, BonferroniÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ0.003), and MAZR in the LCL dataset (fold-enrichmentÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ2.97; BonferroniÃ¢ÂÂ=Ã¢ÂÂ2.18Ã¢ÂÂÃÂÃ¢ÂÂ10Ã¢ÂÂ10); the NFAT transcription factor family, in particular, has demonstrated roles in AD pathology [98, 99]. Several other motifs/TFs known to regulate pathways involved in brain function were also identified, such as PPARG, PPARA, and SP1. Specifically in the context of previous findings in AD, SP1 has been shown to regulate enriched gene sets that exhibit expression changes associated with memory impairment in patients with AD [100]., Overlap between loci of differential methylation/expression, methylation QTLs and eQTLs, and GWAS regions has been observed previously in complex disease. Such findings demonstrate that in addition to the ability to identify novel epigenetic signatures underlying risk or disease progression, EWAS data also provide an opportunity to potentially inform the assignment of putative function to genetic variants associated with disease risk, and may help guide functional analyses of GWAS loci [34]. Of the 479 DMRs identified, 15 fell within ÃÂ±250 kb of a previously reported GWAS SNP, including those associated with CLU, DIP2C, FRMD4A, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1, CTNNA2, and KLK7 (Additional file 10: Table S6); DMRs overlapping promoters of CLU and FRMD4A fell within ÃÂ±2 kb of a GWAS SNP., To further investigate potential functional links with AD GWAS, we integrated DMRs and brain eQTLs with AD GWAS regions, using the regulatory trait approach [70, 71]. We identified 129 risk AD loci that were associated with gene expression of at least one transcript at RTCÃ¢ÂÂÃ¢ÂÂ¥Ã¢ÂÂ0.9. We examined the enrichment of these AD-associated eQTLs with DMRs using GoShifter. There was no significant enrichment with DMRs (hypomethylated or hypermethylated; empirical PÃ¢ÂÂ>Ã¢ÂÂ0.3). However, we found that three AD-associated eQTLs (and SNPs with r
                           2
                  Ã¢ÂÂ>Ã¢ÂÂ0.8) fell inside of AD-DMRs (Additional file 11: Table S7). This included eQTLs associated with the expression of AGPAT1, TAP2, and CLU. Additional file 12: Figure S5AÃ¢ÂÂC shows spatial relationships between DMRs, GWAS SNPs, and eQTLs. Two of these DMRs encompass SNPs in LD with a single GWAS SNP (rs111418223) but two distinct eQTL signals, both of which impact the expression of genes in the vicinity of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene region. TAP2 haplotypes have previously been shown to contribute to AD risk via interactions with APOE4 polymorphisms, with speculated involvement of TAP2 in connections between herpes simplex virus-1 infection and AD [101]. Both AGPAT1 and CLU have roles in lipid/cholesterol metabolism. Specifically, variants in AGPAT1 are associated with variation in levels of circulating sphingolipids and phospholipids in human plasma [82], and impairments of both Agpat1 expression and cholesterol metabolism have also been observed in a rat model of HuntingtonÃ¢ÂÂs disease [102]. A role for CLU in AD pathology has long been suspected, solidified by the identification of variants contributing to AD risk by multiple independent GWAS [103]. Several of these risk variants have been linked to alterations of CLU expression and alternative splicing in AD [103Ã¢ÂÂ105]., We have conducted an epigenome-wide screen in the STG of patients with AD to characterize clusters of CpGs exhibiting concordant disease-associated changes in DNA methylation. After accounting for effects of sample age, gender, ethnicity, and neuronal/glial cell proportions, we identified 479 autosomal DMRs, the majority of which were defined by hypermethylation in AD cases compared to controls. Although the degree of average disease-associated methylation differences was relatively modest within DMRs, this observation is consistent with previous findings in AD and other complex disease [41Ã¢ÂÂ43], including those shown to influence gene expression at both the transcript and protein levels [32, 41Ã¢ÂÂ43]., An important consideration is that, although we accounted for potential effects of cellular composition differences between AD cases and controls in our characterization of differential methylation, additional investigation will be required to assess whether the methylation signatures observed are cell type-specific; this is in fact a limitation of all AD EWAS studies conducted to date using bulk tissue [16]. Despite such limitations, our systems-level analyses of DMRs and associated genes provided evidence for likely roles of these regions in AD pathology. This included observed enrichments of DMR-associated genes for GO terms related to the development and function of neurons, as well as cellular metabolism, both relevant to known molecular and neurological impairments in AD, and consistent with findings from AD transcriptome studies and GWAS [83Ã¢ÂÂ86, 106]., We also found that DMRs were distributed non-randomly in the genome, with biases in their co-localization within gene and CpG island annotations, as well as preferential overlap with specific brain histone methylation signatures and gene promoters harboring brain-relevant TFs. Most notably, we found significant enrichments specifically for hypermethylated DMRs in poised promoters of the adult brain; these loci, characterized by the presence of both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, mark regulatory regions associated with developmental genes that have key roles in cellular differentiation and pluripotency [93, 95]. Poised promoters have also been shown to preferentially overlap CpGs that become hypermethylated with age [26, 94]. Interestingly, we found a strong bias for CpG hypermethylation among AD-DMRs, and that these CpGs were enriched for age-associated methylation changes in our control samples when compared to CpGs within hypomethylated DMRs. Taken together, these points highlight a potential interplay between disease-associated epigenetic alterations and aging in AD pathology, and suggest more targeted research in this area may be warranted., Finally, our results indicate that the study of epigenetic signatures can aid in the characterization of novel genomic regions associated with disease, particularly those overlooked by alternative approaches. Future challenges in the field include the development of effective strategies for integrating epigenetic and transcriptomic profiles with genetic datasets, as a means to better understand the roles of different forms of variation in AD [16].,

                Background
                Bacterial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to identify reservoirs of multidrug-resistant organisms and transmission of these pathogens across healthcare networks. We used WGS to define transmission of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) within a long-term care facility (LTCF), and between this and an acute hospital in the United Kingdom (UK).
              
                Methods
                A longitudinal prospective observational study of faecal VRE carriage was conducted in a LTCF in Cambridge, UK. Stool samples were collected at recruitment, and then repeatedly until the end of the study period, discharge or death. Selective culture media were used to isolate VRE, which were subsequently sequenced and analysed. We also analysed the genomes of 45 Enterococcus faecium bloodstream isolates collected at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH).
              
                Results
                Forty-five residents were recruited during a 6-month period in 2014, and 693 stools were collected at a frequency of at least 1 week apart. Fifty-one stool samples from 3/45 participants (7 %) were positive for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Two residents carried multiple VRE lineages, and one carried a single VRE lineage. Genome analyses based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the core genome indicated that VRE carried by each of the three residents were unrelated. Participants had extensive contact with the local healthcare network. We found that VRE genomes from LTCF residents and hospital-associated bloodstream infection were interspersed throughout the phylogenetic tree, with several instances of closely related VRE strains from the two settings.
              
                Conclusions
                A proportion of LTCF residents are long-term carriers of VRE. Evidence for genetic relatedness between these and VRE associated with bloodstream infection in a nearby acute NHS Trust indicate a shared bacterial population.

We used WGS to define transmission of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) within a long-term care facility (LTCF), and between this and an acute hospital in the United Kingdom (UK)., A longitudinal prospective observational study of faecal VRE carriage was conducted in a LTCF in Cambridge, UK. Stool samples were collected at recruitment, and then repeatedly until the end of the study period, discharge or death. Selective culture media were used to isolate VRE, which were subsequently sequenced and analysed. We also analysed the genomes of 45 Enterococcus faecium bloodstream isolates collected at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH)., Forty-five residents were recruited during a 6-month period in 2014, and 693 stools were collected at a frequency of at least 1 week apart. Fifty-one stool samples from 3/45 participants (7 %) were positive for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Two residents carried multiple VRE lineages, and one carried a single VRE lineage. Genome analyses based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the core genome indicated that VRE carried by each of the three residents were unrelated. Participants had extensive contact with the local healthcare network. We found that VRE genomes from LTCF residents and hospital-associated bloodstream infection were interspersed throughout the phylogenetic tree, with several instances of closely related VRE strains from the two settings., A proportion of LTCF residents are long-term carriers of VRE. Evidence for genetic relatedness between these and VRE associated with bloodstream infection in a nearby acute NHS Trust indicate a shared bacterial population., Over the last decade the introduction of a series of infection control initiatives in acute healthcare environments in the UK has been associated with a dramatic decline in nosocomial infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium difficile [1, 2]. By contrast, the prevalence of bacteraemia caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) has been more resistant to change. Voluntary surveillance in England, Wales and Northern Ireland shows that bacteraemia caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium rose from 16 % to 24 % between 2010 and 2014 [3], with a similar increase observed across Europe [1]. VRE infections are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, healthcare costs and duration of hospital stay compared with vancomycin-susceptible (VSE) infections [4, 5]., Accurate identification of VRE reservoirs and transmission routes provides strategic direction to infection control interventions. Individuals in long-term care facilities (LTCF) frequently move through healthcare networks and are potential reservoirs for VRE [6, 7]. Pathogen transmission between people in long-term residential and acute care facilities is likely to be common [8], but investigation is hampered by the low resolution of current typing methods, which cannot distinguish between isolates belonging to the same clone [9, 10]. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) offers improved resolution, and has been used to delineate pathogen transmission of a range of bacterial species at local, national and global scales [11â14]. WGS also provides the sensitivity to detect genetic diversity of the same clone in an individual [15, 16]. Despite a growing body of data, microbial WGS has not been used to capture a dynamic picture of VRE carriage and transmission within and between interconnected healthcare facilities over time. The aim of this study was to define VRE carriage by residents of a LTCF over a 6-month period, and to use WGS to describe the genetic relatedness of isolates within and between residents, document whether VRE was transmitted in the LTCF over time, and compare these data with the genomes of bloodstream isolates in patients in the nearby acute hospital., We conducted a prospective observational cohort study of faecal VRE carriage in residents of a LTCF over a 6-month period in Cambridge, United Kingdom (UK). The LTCF had 105 beds and was subdivided into five physically separated units, to which residents were assigned based on cognitive impairment and physical disability., All residents admitted to the LTCF during the study period were eligible for inclusion. Residents were excluded if they refused consent, were on an end-of-life care pathway, or were strongly resistant to basic personal care. Written informed consent was obtained from study participants prior to enrolment. For participants who lacked mental capacity, we obtained assent from their consultee. The study protocol was approved by the National Research Ethics Service (REC ref: 13/LO/1278) and the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Research and Development department (ref: A093007). All study procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki., Data were collected from medical records and nursing care plans. This included demographics (age, gender, unit of residence), presence of co-morbidities (Charlson co-morbidity Index), presence of urinary or faecal incontinence or a urinary catheter, a history of VRE carriage or infection in the 12 months prior to enrolment, and infection and antibiotic use during the study. Data were also collected on healthcare contact (inpatient admission, outpatient clinic attendance, or general practitioner (GP) surgery visit) in the 12 months prior to enrolment and during the study period. Stool samples were collected at recruitment and then repeatedly (up to once a week) until the end of the study period, discharge from the LTCF or death., Stool samples were cultured within 24 h of collection on Monday to Friday, or within 48 h if collected at weekends. A 10 Î¼L loopful was added to 5 mL Brain-Heart Infusion Broth (BHI) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) containing 3 Î¼g/mL vancomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, US) and incubated at 37 Â°C in air at 100 rpm for 24 h. A total of 200 Î¼L was plated onto Brilliance VRE agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK) and incubated at 37 Â°C for 48 h. Purple or blue colonies (putative E. faecium or E. faecalis, respectively) were sub-cultured on Columbia Blood agar (CBA, Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK), incubated at 37 Â°C for 48 h, and the species confirmed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) (Bruker Daltoniks, Bremen, Germany). Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using the Vitek2 instrument (BioMÃ©rieux, Marcy lâEtoile, France) and the AST-P607 card. All stools positive for VRE were cultured for VSE. A 10 Î¼L loopful was plated onto Brilliance UTI agar (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK). Presumptive enterococci were sub-cultured on CBA containing a 5 Î¼g vancomycin disc (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK). Colonies growing at the edge of the zone of inhibition were selected for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing as above., Genomic DNA was extracted from a pure bacterial culture based on a single colony using the QIAxtractor (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany). Library preparation was based on the Illumina protocol, and sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2000 with 100-cycle paired-end runs. Sequence reads were assembled using Velvet and mapped to the E. faecium reference genome Aus0004 (European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) accession number CP003351) using SMALT [17]. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were identified (genes annotated as plasmid-, phage-, IS- or transposon-associated) and removed. Gubbins was used to remove regions of recombination [18], creating a core genome. Core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to estimate maximum likelihood trees using RAxML [19] with 100 bootstraps and a midpoint root. The multilocus sequence type (ST) was derived from sequence data using an in-house script and the MLST database [20]. vanA and vanB were detected by in silico polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using published primers [21, 22]. Isolates positive for vanA were mapped to a Tn1546 reference (ENA accession number M97297). The nucleotide sequences of the Tn1546 transposon, and those up- and downstream of the transposon, in each isolate were identified as described by Howden et al. [23] using Artemis [24], and queried against each other and nucleotide databases using BLAST. Isolates positive for vanB were mapped to Aus0004 Tn1549 [25] and up- and downstream nucleotide sequences identified as for vanA. Plasmid replicon (rep) typing was performed using in silico PCR and published primers [26, 27]., Whole-genome sequences were available for 45 E. faecium bloodstream isolates collected between January and December 2012 at the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH) (S. Peacock, personal communication). These consisted of the first stored isolate for 45 patients, identified using the diagnostic microbiology laboratory database at CUH. Information on date of isolation and patient location was available. These isolates had been sequenced as part of a previous study, approved by the National Research Ethics Service (REC ref: 12/EE/0439) and the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust R&D Department (ref: A092685). Sequence data for all study isolates have been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive with the accession numbers shown in Additional file 1., Forty-five of the 90 (50 %) eligible residents were recruited. Participants had a median age of 82 years (range, 40â104 years; interquartile range (IQR), 71â87 years), and 29 (64 %) were female. Three participants were lost to follow-up during the study because of death (nâ=â2) or transfer to another facility (nâ=â1). The median duration of residence in the study facility at the time of recruitment was 16 months (range, 5 days to 54 months; IQR, 6â41 months). The median Charlson co-morbidity Index was 6 (range, 0â10). Thirty-three (73 %) participants were incontinent of urine and faeces (three of whom had an indwelling urinary catheter), and two (5 %) participants had urinary incontinence alone. One participant (P7) had a history of VRE infection (of the urinary tract) in the 12 months prior to recruitment., The majority of residents (38/45, 85 %) had previously resided in another healthcare facility. Movement of participants through the healthcare network is summarised in Table 1. Healthcare contact was extensive, with more than half of participants (nâ=â26, 58 %) having at least one episode of healthcare contact (hospital admission, outpatient clinic attendance or visit to a GP surgery) in the 12 months prior to recruitment, and six participants having between 1 and 5 (total of 19) episodes of healthcare contact during the study. There were 61 infections recorded in 23 (51 %) participants (median, 2 infections per case; range, 1â5) during the 6-month study period, although none of these were associated with VRE. The most common site of infection was the urinary tract (nâ=â33, 54 %), followed by respiratory tract (nâ=â16) and skin and soft tissue infection (nâ=â8). The focus of infection in four cases was not specified. All participants with a urinary catheter had at least one urinary tract infection recorded during the study period. The 23 participants received 63 courses of antibiotics (median, 2 courses; range, 1â6).Table 1

                    , A total of 693 stools were collected over the 6-month study period, at a frequency of at least 1 week apart. Fifty-one stools from three participants (7 %) were positive for VRE, all of which were E. faecium (nâ=â24, 21 and 6 positive samples for P7, P15 and P31, respectively). This included the participant (P7) who had a past history of VRE infection. Figure 1a shows the timing of positive and negative samples for each of the three cases. STs of the 51 VRE isolates were identified from the sequence data, which assigned the isolates to six STs (ST18, ST80, ST117, ST203, ST780 and ST787). A notable feature was that two residents (P7 and P15) each carried multiple STs with no overlap in STs between the two cases: P7 carried ST80 (isolated from 20 stool samples), ST117 (nâ=â2), and ST203 (nâ=â2), and P15 carried ST787 (isolated from 18 stool samples), ST18 (nâ=â2), and ST780 (nâ=â1). The third VRE positive resident (P31) carried a single ST that was assigned to ST203. In silico PCR demonstrated that the 51 VRE isolates carried vanA.

                      , A phylogenetic tree for the 51 VRE isolates based on SNPs in the core genome is shown in Fig. 1b. P7 carried four genetically distinct lineages (two of which belonged to ST80), and P15 carried three, with no evidence for carriage of related strains by these two residents. The majority of VRE isolates from P7 and P15 each belonged to a single lineage (18/24 (75 %), and 18/21 (86 %)), with a median pairwise SNP difference within each of these two clusters of 3 (range, 0â6) and 1 (range, 0â6), respectively. P7 and P31 both carried VRE isolates belonging to ST203, but these were genetically distinct (median SNP difference of 74; range, 73â74), excluding transmission between them (Fig. 1b). The VRE-positive participants resided in different units. All three VRE positive participants had healthcare contact in the 12 months prior to the study, including hospital admission (5 episodes), outpatient clinic attendance (3 episodes) or attendance at Accident and Emergency Department without admission (1 episode), and one VRE positive participant (P7) had healthcare contact during the study consisting of four inpatient admissions and five outpatient clinic attendances., To identify the genomic location of the vanA transposon and its relatedness within and between participants, we analysed the region of sequence adjacent to the transposon in each isolate. This was possible for 30 isolates from the three participants and included four STs (ST80, 117, 203 and 787). The highest match in the blast database predicted that the transposon was present on the pLG1 mega-plasmid (accession numbers HM565234 and HM565172) [28] for 29/30 isolates, (100 % ID up to 5998 bp) and was adjacent to a gene encoding a cadmium efflux system accessory protein. Blast analysis of the remaining isolate (from P15) gave multiple matches to regions in E. faecium strain DO plasmid 2 (accession number CP003585) [29], p5753cB (GQ900487) [30], pS177 (HQ115078) [31], pF856 (JQ663598) [32] and pRUM (AF507977) [33]. To analyse the similarity between the putative pLG1 plasmid transposons, sequence reads for the 29 genomes were mapped to a reference vanA transposon. This revealed that the six genomes from P31 isolates shared 100 % identity with the reference, while 23 isolates from P7 were identical with the exception of the same SNP at position 8634. We also characterised variation in plasmids using rep typing, which demonstrated the presence of seven types (10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 20 and pMG1) with a range of 2â7 rep types per isolate. There was variation in the presence of rep types, both within and between individual STs, which extended to variation within the same individual., All 51 VRE-positive stools were cultured for the presence of VSE, which was identified in 25 (49 %) stools from the three participants (nâ=â9, 15 and 1 for P7, P15 and P31, respectively). MLST was identified from the sequence data, which assigned the isolates to nine STs. As before, P7 and P15 carried multiple STs: P7 carried ST80, ST117 and ST203 (mirroring the VRE STs in this individual) together with ST127 (a single locus variant of ST80), while P15 carried ST787 and ST18 (mirroring the VRE STs in this individual), together with two STs not represented in the VRE population (ST206 and ST17). By contrast, the VSE carried by P31 was assigned to an ST that was different from their VRE strain (ST328). Rep typing of the VSE isolates revealed the same rep types found in the VRE isolates, with a median of 6 rep types per isolate (range, 2â7). No rep types were specific to VRE or VSE. One phenotypically vancomycin susceptible isolate carried the vanB gene (P15-week(W)12-ST17) based on in silico PCR. This isolate lacked the vanR and vanS genes from whole genome sequence data and from the assembled Tn1549 transposon. Loss of vanR and vanS from the van operon resulting in a susceptible phenotype has been described previously for vanA-positive isolates [32, 34]. A phylogenetic tree of the 51 VRE and 25 VSE isolates based on core genome SNPs is shown in Additional file 2. This showed that the VSE carried by P7 and P15 were closely related to their resident VRE populations demonstrating possible in vivo acquisition or loss of resistance, whilst as expected the VSE carried by P31 was not closely related to their VRE., Sequence data for VRE isolates from study participants were compared with that for 45 E. faecium isolates from patients with bloodstream infection at the nearby acute hospital during 2012. Phenotypic susceptibility testing demonstrated that 41 isolates were vancomycin-resistant (all of which carried vanA), and four isolates were vancomycin-susceptible. A phylogenetic tree of the 51 VRE from stool and 45 hospital isolates based on core genome SNPs showed that carriage isolates from the three study participants were interspersed throughout the tree (Fig. 2a). There were several examples where isolates from the LTCF and hospital were highly related (Fig. 2b and c) which included two sets of isolates from P15 and one from P7. One of these clusters included two VRE isolates from P7 that were closely related to six hospital-associated VRE bloodstream isolates cultured in 2012 (minimum pairwise SNP difference of 4; range, 4â15) and one from P15 with a minimum pairwise SNP difference of 6 (Fig. 2b). P7 was not admitted to CUH during 2012, but was admitted twice during 2013 (for 1.5 and 2 months, respectively) and was also admitted to CUH on four further occasions during the study period. Comparison of transposons and sequences downstream of their insertion between the LTCF and hospital isolates was possible for five of these six hospital isolates. This revealed that the transposon sequences and downstream sequences for 4/5 were identical to the two isolates from P7. The fifth hospital isolate had two SNPs and an 89 bp insertion in the sequence downstream of the transposon. A second cluster involved VRE carried by P15 and VRE bloodstream isolates from two patients, the closest of which also differed by six SNPs (Fig. 2c). A case note review revealed that P15 was admitted to the CUH on three occasions in 2012, and had ampicillin-resistant E. faecium isolated from urine during the third admission. P15 was an inpatient at the same time, but not on the same ward as the two patients with bloodstream infection in this cluster (Fig. 2c). The four vancomycin-susceptible isolates were found to be carrying vanB by in silico PCR. Additionally, we noted that the single isolate positive for vanB isolated from P15 clustered with the four vanB positive hospital-associated bloodstream isolates, the closest of which was 12 SNPs different based on a core genome comparison. Mapping of these isolates to the Aus0004 Tn1549 transposon demonstrated that the transposons and their downstream sequences were identical to that of the vanB-positive isolate from the LTCF.

                      , Residents of LTCFs are at increased risk of infection from a range of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) compared with the general population [35, 36]. This may be related to several factors, including frequent healthcare contact and high levels of antibiotic use. Furthermore, LTCF are often akin to a home environment, where screening for MDROs is not routinely performed and isolation of residents may be detrimental to care. The combination of these factors represents a perfect storm for the control of MDRO., In this study, we focused on carriage and transmission of VRE, a nosocomial pathogen that has remained a persistent problem despite the raft of infection control measures introduced into UK hospitals to reduce the prevalence of MRSA and C. difficile. We found that 7 % of residents carried VRE in their stool on at least one occasion, a finding consistent with previous studies in Israel, Germany and the United States [6, 7, 37]. Our longitudinal study design allowed us to investigate carriage over time. This identified variability in the duration of carriage, with two long-term carriers and one individual who appeared to lose VRE carriage during the study. Intermittent and transient VRE carriage has been described previously [38, 39]. Genome sequencing was used to determine the genetic relatedness of VRE isolates. The advantage of doing so became apparent on comparing this with the results of in silico MLST. Reliance on MLST could have led to an incorrect link being made between two residents (P7 and P31) who both carried VRE ST203 which were not closely related on sequencing., Sequencing of VSE in VRE-positive participants demonstrated that two individuals carried multiple VSE lineages that were closely related to their VRE isolates. This is consistent with the findings of Howden et al. [23] that VRE and VSE across the species are not genetically distinct. VSE strains may have gained resistance via horizontal gene transfer from colonising VRE lineages. We identified identical vanA transposons and insertion sites in multiple STs from P7, suggesting possible sharing of the vanA mobile genetic element within patients. Rep types were not distinct between VRE and VSE populations, and varied within STs, suggesting the presence of highly mobile plasmids., A combination of epidemiological and sequence data allowed us to consider the source of VRE acquisition. While the LTCF environment might be expected to lead to multiple transmission events, there was no evidence for direct transmission of VRE within the study facility. Prior evidence for transmission of VRE in LTCFs is limited, with a single point prevalence study suggesting transmission between 3/188 residents based on pulse field gel electrophoresis [40]. Instead, the source of acquisition may be linked to the frequent interaction with healthcare facilities as two persistent carriers with a history of extensive healthcare contact carried multiple VRE lineages, the majority of which have been associated previously with the healthcare setting based on MLST [41]. This indicates long-term carriage (over 6 months) of hospital-associated lineages in community-based care facilities., Comparison of WGS data for VRE from the LTCF and the acute hospital to which the participants are referred provided the opportunity to compare the relatedness of isolates drawn from different parts of the same healthcare network. This demonstrated that isolates associated with bloodstream infection were highly related to those carried by the LTCF residents. Direct transmission between the study participants and hospital patients is unlikely, but two of the participants carrying VRE were admitted to the hospital within a relevant timeframe for exposure to the circulating VRE lineages. Furthermore, repeated admission of the study participants represents a mechanism for perpetuation of these lineages. The sequence downstream of the vanA transposon in two of the LTCF isolates was identical to four of five hospital isolates closely related to them, providing further evidence for transmission of VRE from hospitals to community care facilities. Additionally, this region of sequence in the genetically more stable vanB Tn1549 transposon of the LTCF isolate matched those from the hospital also carrying vanB., Our study has several limitations. First, only half of the residents in the study facility agreed to participate in the study, which may have obscured transmission events between study participants and individuals who were not recruited. Second, we only sequenced a single colony from each stool sample, which may have affected our ability to detect carriage of more than one VRE lineage. However, this risk was mitigated by repeated sampling of individual patients over time, which did demonstrate carriage of multiple lineages in long-term carriers. Evidence for concurrent carriage of multiple HCA lineages of enterococci is limited, but has implications for current screening and WGS techniques based upon single cultures. Finally, we only had access to the genome sequence of bloodstream isolates from the acute hospital, which may not be fully representative of the carriage population in this setting. Despite this, we were still able to provide evidence demonstrating that clones had been shared between the hospital and LTCF., This study has confirmed that a proportion of residents in a community-based long-term care facility carried VRE in stool, genome sequencing of which demonstrated multiple lineages in some cases but no evidence for transmission between residents. This population frequently requires admission to hospital, where they may acquire nosocomial pathogens as well as transmit existing strains to hospital patients and shed organisms into the environment. A genome comparison of VRE carriage isolates in the LTCF and VRE bloodstream isolates confirmed that VRE in the two populations were highly related. This shared population is likely to reflect two-way transmission. Tackling multidrug-resistant pathogens in hospitals requires an understanding of reservoirs and transmission of bacteria within highly connected healthcare facilities, together with infection control policies that consider this as a continuum.,

                Background
                Warfarin is the most widely used oral anticoagulant worldwide, but it has a narrow therapeutic index which necessitates constant monitoring of anticoagulation response. Previous genome-wide studies have focused on identifying factors explaining variance in stable dose, but have not explored the initial patient response to warfarin, and a wider range of clinical and biochemical factors affecting both initial and stable dosing with warfarin.
              
                Methods
                A prospective cohort of 711 patients starting warfarin was followed up for 6 months with analyses focusing on both non-genetic and genetic factors. The outcome measures used were mean weekly warfarin dose (MWD), stable mean weekly dose (SMWD) and international normalised ratio (INR) > 4 during the first week. Samples were genotyped on the Illumina Human610-Quad chip. Statistical analyses were performed using Plink and R.
              
                Results
                VKORC1 and CYP2C9 were the major genetic determinants of warfarin MWD and SMWD, with CYP4F2 having a smaller effect. Age, height, weight, cigarette smoking and interacting medications accounted for less than 20 % of the variance. Our multifactorial analysis explained 57.89 % and 56.97 % of the variation for MWD and SMWD, respectively. Genotypes for VKORC1 and CYP2C9*3, age, height and weight, as well as other clinical factors such as alcohol consumption, loading dose and concomitant drugs were important for the initial INR response to warfarin. In a small subset of patients for whom data were available, levels of the coagulation factors VII and IX (highly correlated) also played a role.
              
                Conclusion
                Our multifactorial analysis in a prospectively recruited cohort has shown that multiple factors, genetic and clinical, are important in determining the response to warfarin. VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genetic polymorphisms are the most important determinants of warfarin dosing, and it is highly unlikely that other common variants of clinical importance influencing warfarin dosage will be found. Both VKORC1 and CYP2C9*3 are important determinants of the initial INR response to warfarin. Other novel variants, which did not reach genome-wide significance, were identified for the different outcome measures, but need replication.

Other novel variants, which did not reach genome-wide significance, were identified for the different outcome measures, but need replication., Warfarin is the most widely used oral anticoagulant worldwide for the treatment of thromboembolic disorders [1]. The wide inter-individual variability in warfarin dose requirement, and its narrow therapeutic index makes the outcome of treatment difficult to predict; under-anticoagulation can predispose patients to thrombosis, while over-anticoagulation increases the risk of bleeding [2]. A number of interventions have been used to improve the accuracy of warfarin dosing including home monitoring [3], computer-based dosing [4], different dosing algorithms [5] and more intensive monitoring [6]. However, despite these measures, accurate warfarin dosing remains difficult to achieve. Warfarin appears in the top three of most epidemiological surveys of adverse reactions causing hospital admission [7]. There is thus a need to improve the safety of warfarin., Genetic factors are known to predict warfarin dose requirements - observational studies have shown that variation in CYP2C9 and VKORC1, together with body mass index and age, account for about 50 % of the variation in warfarin daily dose requirements [8]. Many dosing algorithms incorporating both genetic and clinical factors for predicting warfarin doses during initiation and maintenance phases of therapy have been developed [9]. The FDA has changed the drug label [10] because of the distinct role genetics plays on warfarin dose requirement. We have recently undertaken a randomised controlled trial of genotype-guided dosing versus standard clinical practice [11] - this showed that genotyping prior to warfarin prescription increased the time within therapeutic range of international normalised ratio (INR) between 2.0-3.0 by a mean of 7.0 %. However, the COAG trial [12], conducted in the US, which used a different algorithmic strategy did not show any difference in the time within therapeutic INR range between genotype-guided and clinical dosing algorithms. There are several possible reasons for the discordant findings between the two trials [13]., We cannot exclude the possibility that other factors, either genetic, clinical or biochemical, could improve personalisation of dosing for warfarin, and thereby its efficacy and safety. In order to evaluate this, we have undertaken further analyses of our UK prospective cohort study [14], where the clinical phenotype of each patient has been extensively documented, together with measurement of clinical laboratory tests, and the vitamin-K dependent coagulation factors. In this paper, we report on the results of these analyses of the response to warfarin for both the initiation (first week of dosing) and maintenance (stable anticoagulation) periods. Our aim was to identify additional clinical, biochemical and genetic factors that explain the as yet unexplained 50 % of variation in warfarin dose requirements., Blood samples, demographic and clinical data from patients initiating warfarin for venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation between November 2004 and March 2006 were collected, as described previously [14]. Updated patient demographics for this extended cohort are available in Table 1. The study, which conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki, was approved by the Birmingham South Research Ethics Committee, and each patient provided informed consent to participate in the study.Table 1

There were four fixed study visits for each patient, the first at the time of initiation of warfarin (index visit), then at 1 week, 8 weeks and 26 weeks of warfarin therapy. The index visit was before, or within 2 days of commencing warfarin, in 58 % of patients, 26 % of index visits were on the third day, and the remainder between 4 and 9 days after starting warfarin. Out of 160 patients for which baseline clotting factor and protein levels were measured, only eight had their index visit after starting warfarin (three on day 1, four on day 2, and one on day 4). To confirm that timing of initiation relative to index visit did not significantly influence baseline clotting factor and protein levels, patients were stratified and these measurements compared between strata; trends in clotting factors relating to index day were also investigated. No significant trends were found, most probably because of the important natural population variation observed in the levels of clotting factors and the small number of patients for which data were collected after warfarin initiation (data available on request). Patients also attended anticoagulant clinic between these four fixed visits as per usual clinical practice, and the total number of INR measurements varied (median number of INRs per patient: 15; range: 1â65)., At the index visit, patient demographics, smoking history, current medications and alcohol intake (assessed using the AUDIT questionnaire [15]) were collected. At all subsequent follow-up visits, any adverse effects, changes in warfarin dose or changes in any other medications since the previous visit were recorded. The list of medications classified as interacting with warfarin is available in Additional file 1 on Sheet 1; the interaction coefficient indicates if the substance reduces (â1) or potentiates (+1) the action of warfarin; amiodaroneâs coefficient was set to +2 to reflect its strong effect. All other medications taken by patients and deemed not to have any effect on warfarin dosing are also listed in Additional file 1 on Sheet 2., For this GWAS, we used the following outcome measures:(1)
                        Mean weekly dose (MWD): mean dose received weekly during a minimum follow-up time of 14 days post-loading; the loading period, that is, the first 3 days of treatment, was not included in the calculations.
                       (2)
                        Stable mean weekly dose (SMWD): mean weekly dose for at least three consecutive visits where INRs were within the targeted range, spanning a minimum of 14 days and with at least 7 days separating the first and middle INR measurements, and the middle and last one.
                       (3)
                        INR >4.0 in the first week on warfarin.
                       , Mean weekly dose (MWD): mean dose received weekly during a minimum follow-up time of 14 days post-loading; the loading period, that is, the first 3 days of treatment, was not included in the calculations., Stable mean weekly dose (SMWD): mean weekly dose for at least three consecutive visits where INRs were within the targeted range, spanning a minimum of 14 days and with at least 7 days separating the first and middle INR measurements, and the middle and last one., INR >4.0 in the first week on warfarin., As the frequency distribution of stable warfarin dose was skewed, the data were normalised by taking square-root of stable dose., Samples were assayed on the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip using the Infinium HD Super Assay (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA); beadchips were scanned with an iScan. Intensity data, normalised according to the standard Illumina algorithm, was extracted and genotypes called using Illuminus [16]. Sample call rate was calculated and Illuminus re-run using only the samples with a call rate of at least 90 % (to improve cluster definition)., Samples having a call rate of less than 95 % or having autosomal heterozygosity values in the tail of the distribution were excluded. Chromosome X heterozygosity was used to predict gender (samples with values less than 4 % are predicted as male, those with values over 15 % are predicted as female); this was compared to the gender in the original documentation, and discrepancies resolved or samples excluded. A pairwise comparison was run for all samples using 400 well-spaced, common SNPs to identify duplicate samples. Genotypes for each sample were compared to the molecular fingerprint - a set of 26 markers typed using the Sequenom platform - to eliminate the possibility of arraying errors. Identity by descent (IBD) was calculated for all pairs of samples using PLINK [17], and one sample was excluded from each pair for which Pi hat, the proportion IBD, was superior or equal to 0.1875., Imputation of genotypes was carried out using IMPUTE V2.1 [18], with the filtered combined set of HapMap 3 release 2 (Feb 2009) and 1000 genomes pilot 1 CEU (March 2010) [19]. Full details are provided in the Additional file 2., A suite of Perl and R (2009) scripts were used as a framework to utilise the R package CNVtools, available from http://âwww.âbioconductor.âorg/âpackages/ârelease/âbioc/âhtml/âCNVtools.âhtml [20]. All the steps are detailed in the Additional file 2., Genotyping of rs112942398 was performed with a custom KASPâ¢ genotyping assay (LGC Genomics Ltd.) using the 68-62 Â°C touchdown thermal cycling conditions in accordance with the manufacturerâs instructions. Primer sequences are as follow:

                      Primer Allele HEX (T) GTAATCCCAGCACTTTGGGAGGA, and

                        , Primer Allele FAM (G) AATCCCAGCACTTTGGGAGGC,, Primer Allele HEX (T) GTAATCCCAGCACTTTGGGAGGA, and, Primer Common GGCTGGATTCGGACCCCTGGA., Approximately 30 ng genomic DNA was amplified in a 5 Î¼L reaction mixture containing 1Ã high ROX KASP genotyping master mix and 0.07 Î¼L of primer mix. To improve genotype clustering, the plate was thermally cycled for an extra 10 cycles with an annealing/elongation temperature of 64 Â°C. End-point FAM and HEX signals were read at 30 Â°C on an ABI 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). As part of quality control, negative controls (nâ=â2) containing water instead of DNA and 10 % duplicates were included in the run., Non-genetic variables used for testing univariately for association with each outcome were age, height, weight, BMI, gender, loading dose, total follow-up time, dosing method (manual or computerised), mean target INR, blood count (haemoglobin, platelets, white cells, neutrophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils), potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, urea, creatinine, triglycerides, albumin, total protein, bilirubin, ALT, alkaline phosphate, gamma GT, fibrinogen, coagulation factors II, V, VII, IX and X, Proteins C and S, current smoking status, number of cigarette smoked per day, ex-smoker status, alcohol consumption, interacting co-medication (binary), non-interacting co-medication (binary), sum of effect of interacting co-medications. The coagulation factors were measured as described by Jorgensen et al. [8]. For each variable, either a linear (quantitative outcomes) or logistic (binary outcome) regression was used to test for association with outcome in R, and variables found to be significant univariately (P â¤0.05) were included as covariates in the linear or logistic regressions used to test for association between each SNP and outcome in turn, carried out in PLINK. When a SNP was found to be significantly associated with the outcome tested (at genome-wide significance level, P â¤5âÃâ10â8), it was added as a covariate to the multiple regression model and each SNP was then re-tested for association with the outcome using this updated model. This process was repeated until no further SNP reached genome-wide significance., To avoid collinearity, all variables were checked for pairwise correlation using Pearsonâs correlation test in R; pairs with a correlation over 0.7 were deemed highly correlated and, in the event that they were found significantly associated with in any of the investigated outcomes, only the one variable with the lowest P value was adjusted for when testing for association with the SNPs., For each outcome, all significantly associated SNPs at genome-wide level, as well as the non-genetic variables found significant univariately were then included together in a multiple regression model in R. Stepwise variable selection was applied to the model to establish a final model. When known variants influencing warfarin dosing (such as VKORC1 rs9923231, CYP2C9*2 or *3, and CYP4F2 rs2108622) did not reach genome-wide significance, possibly through lack of power, they were added to the stepwise variable selection in order to determine if they would indeed improve the final model., Manhattan and regional plots were prepared using in-house Python scripts. MWD results were further analysed through the use of IPA (IngenuityÂ® Systems, www.âingenuity.âcom). Canonical pathways analysis identified the pathways from the IPA library of canonical pathways that were most significant to the dataset. SNPs considered for canonical pathway analysis had a P value lower than 10â03., The mean age was 69 years (range: 19â95 years) and 55.6 % were men. Patients were treated for atrial fibrillation (AF; 66.0 %), venous thromboembolism (VTE; 24.5 %), cardiovascular disease (comprising ischaemic heart disease, congenital cardiac failure, heart valve disease and other pathologies, total 7.6 %) or other conditions (comprising respiratory disease, cerebrovascular accident/transient ischaemic attack, gastrointestinal disease, neurological disease and other pathologies, total 2.1 %)., Seven patients failed the genotyping rate threshold, nine failed the heterozygosity criteria, 15 were excluded based on ethnicity using principal component analysis with HapMap3 samples as they did not cluster with samples of European ancestry (data not shown), three had ambiguous gender, three were excluded because of IBD, and four patients decided not to participate in the study, leaving 711 available genotypes for analysis. One hundred patients stopped treatment within the first 2 weeks of treatment, not allowing their inclusion for mean weekly dose calculation, though 13 with appropriate available data were included in INR >4 calculations., Out of 612 patients with dose and INR information fitting our SMWD outcome, only 326 (53.3 %) reached stability over the follow-up period, which covered up to 277 days. One hundred and nineteen (16.6 %) patients were current smokers (Nâ=â711, mean number of cigarettesâ=â12.7, sdâ=â8.9). Out of 625, 116 (18.6 %) patients had an INR >4.0 during the first week of treatment. Out of the 711 patients retained for analysis, 160 had baseline data on full blood count, liver enzymes and coagulation factor levels. Weight and BMI were highly correlated (R2â=â0.73), as were gender and height (R2â=â0.83), current smoking status and number of cigarettes smoked (R2â=â0.79); therefore, only the most significant variable of each pair was kept as a covariate in the regression analyses., For MWD, age (Pâ=â1.20âÃâ10â17), height (Pâ=â5.10âÃâ10â07), weight (Pâ=â5.02âÃâ10â10), total follow-up time (Pâ=â9.41âÃâ10â03), number of cigarettes smoked per day (Pâ=â5.34âÃâ10â06), ex-smoker status (Pâ=â3.01âÃâ10â04), alcohol consumption (Pâ=â2.00âÃâ10â04) as well as the use of interacting co-medications (Pâ=â6.30âÃâ10â03), the sum of interactions (Pâ=â1.38âÃâ10â04), and the use of medications not classified as interacting (Pâ=â2.94âÃâ10â02) were found significant univariately and therefore adjusted for when testing for association with each SNP. MWD increased with height and weight, and decreased with age; it was higher for smokers and increased with the number of cigarettes smoked each day, while it appeared to be lower for ex-smokers in comparison to people who never smoked. MWD was lower in patients taking interacting co-medications, and decreased as the sum of interactions increased, but it also appeared to be lower in patients taking co-medications which are not on the interacting medications list., In the subset of samples with extra baseline data, age (Pâ=â2.06âÃâ10â05), height (Pâ=â2.43âÃâ10â03), weight (Pâ=â3.58âÃâ10â04), haemoglobin (Pâ=â3.64âÃâ10â02), basophils (Pâ=â9.20âÃâ10â03), urea (Pâ=â4.16âÃâ10â02), ALT (Pâ=â4.71âÃâ10â02), Factor IX (Pâ=â7.19âÃâ10â03) and current smoking status (Pâ=â3.36âÃâ10â04) were found significant univariately and included as covariates in the linear regressions. Though not found univariately significant in this subset of patients, the use of interacting co-medications, the sum of interactions, and the use of medications not classified as interacting were also used as covariates in the linear regressions., For SMWD, age (Pâ=â6.20âÃâ10â09), height (Pâ=â1.72âÃâ10â05), weight (Pâ=â2.11âÃâ10â07) and the use of interacting co-medications (Pâ=â6.62âÃâ10â03) were found significant univariately and adjusted for when testing for association with each SNP. SMWD increased with height and weight, and decreased with age, and was lower in patients taking interacting co-medications., For INR >4.0 during first week of treatment (INR4), age (Pâ=â2.77âÃâ10â03), height (Pâ=â1.53âÃâ10â02), weight (Pâ=â2.98âÃâ10â04), loading dose (Pâ=â7.28âÃâ10â07), alcohol consumption (Pâ=â7.76âÃâ10â03) and use of medications (during first week of treatment) not classified as interacting (Pâ=â4.28âÃâ10â02) were found significant univariately and included as covariates in the logistic regressions. In addition to these, in the subset of patient with extra baseline data, triglycerides (Pâ=â4.97âÃâ10â02), albumin (Pâ=â4.23âÃâ10â02) and Factor VII (Pâ=â3.82âÃâ10â02) were also found significantly associated with INR4., For warfarin MWD (Table 2 and Fig. 1a), genome-wide significant signals clustered on chromosome 16 around VKORC1, and on chromosome 10 around CYP2C9. The top signal in VKORC1 was rs9923231 (Pâ=â5.00âÃâ10â50). In CYP2C9, the strongest signal, rs4917639 (Pâ=â2.05âÃâ10â30) acts as a composite of CYP2C9*2 and *3 [21]; nevertheless, both *3 (rs1057910, Pâ=â1.24âÃâ10â23) and *2 (rs1799853, Pâ=â1.65âÃâ10â09) also reached genome-wide significance.Table 2

                      , After adjustment for genetic and non-genetic covariates, no other SNP reached genome-wide significance (Fig. 1b). The previously described signal in CYP4F2, rs2108622 [22, 23] was absent from top hits after multiple regression (Table 2 and Fig. 1b; Pâ=â7.70âÃâ10â03), explaining only a further 0.5 % of the MWD variance. Examination of genes at proximity of other signals of interest did not yield any obvious candidates based on gene function. Canonical pathway analysis in IPA, however, using all signals with a P value below 10â03, highlighted the thrombin signalling pathway, with 12 independent signals with P values ranging from 7.8âÃâ10â04 to 2.2âÃâ10â06 (Table 3), and a P value of 4.6â04for the pathway as a whole. We performed univariate regressions to investigate if any of these 12 variants were linked to coagulation factor levels (data not shown). One variant, rs2298978, appeared significantly associated with Factor IX levels (Pâ=â1.26â03, Bonferroni threshold: 4.15â03).Table 3

                    , After stepwise regression including all significant non-genetic covariates as well as rs9923231, rs1057910 and rs1799853, ex-smoker status and alcohol consumption were not retained in the final model. Percentage of the MWD variance explained in the complete model was 57.4 % (breakdown was age 11.20 %, height 3.56 %, weight 5.98 %, follow-up time 1.20 %, number of cigarettes smoked/day 3.12 %, interacting co-medications 0.98 %, sum of effects of interacting medications 2.20 %, non-interacting medications 0.61 %, rs9923231 25.61 %, rs1057910 12.93 % and rs1799853 3.72 %). Inclusion of rs2108622 (CYP4F2) brought the total variation explained to 57.89 %., In the 160 patients for which baseline blood count and coagulation factor levels were available, age, height, weight, haemoglobin, basophils, urea, ALT, factor IX and smoking status were found significant in the univariate regression on MWD, and included as covariates in the multiple regression models. As expected given the low power, only rs9923231 (VKORC1) reached genome-wide significance, as well as an imputed SNP in the CYP2C9 locus (rs1072753, R2â=â0.61 with rs1057910, CYP2C9*3, in 1000 genome project pilot 1) (Additional file 3). CYP2C9*3, instead of the imputed rs1072753, was used in the stepwise regression. Only age (13.39 %), weight (7.58 %), Factor IX (4.37 %), smoking status (9.98 %), rs9923231 (18.15 %) and rs1057910 (14.97 %) were retained in the final model, explaining a total of 59.64 % of the MWD variation., For warfarin SMWD (Additional file 1 Sheet 3), the univariate signals (Fig. 2a) were rs9923231 (Pâ=â9.26âÃâ10â32) for VKORC1, and rs4917639 (composite CYP2C9 *2/*3, Pâ=â5.26âÃâ10â15) and rs1057910 (CYP2C9*3, Pâ=â3.95âÃâ10â09) for CYP2C9, while rs1799853 (CYP2C9*2, Pâ=â4.70âÃâ10â07) did not reach genome-wide significance. Despite not reaching genome-wide significance, rs1799853 was included in the multiple regression as it influences warfarin dose, along with rs9923231 and rs1057910. Three signals reached genome-wide significance after adjusting for genetic and non-genetic factors (Fig. 2b): 6â106244024 (Pâ=â6.15âÃâ10â09), 11â15383178 (Pâ=â6.23âÃâ10â09) and rs112942398 (Pâ=â2.40âÃâ10â08). All these SNPs are the result of imputation; there is close to no support from surrounding genotyped SNPs for 11â15383178 and 6â106244024 (data not shown), unlike for rs112942398 (Additional file 4), which is gene-rich, but none of the genes had a link to warfarin metabolism or blood coagulation. To further assess the validity of rs112942398, 94 samples were genotyped using a KASPar custom assay; 10 of the aforementioned samples were given as homozygous for the minor allele by the imputation, and 42 were given as heterozygous, the remainder being given as homozygous for the major allele. Four samples failed genotyping, leaving 90 genotypes available for comparison. There were 12 discordant genotypes between imputation and KASPar genotyping, giving an approximate imputation error rate of 13.3 %.

                      , All covariates from the multiple regression remained in the final model after stepwise regression, with age explaining 9.72 % of SMWD variation, height 4.45 %, weight 7.94 %, interacting co-medications 1.92 %, rs9923231 30.38 %, rs1057910 8.08 % and rs1799853 3.81 %. The final model explained 55.27 % of the variation. Inclusion of rs2108622, retained after stepwise regression, brought the total variation explained to 56.97 %., Age, height, weight, loading dose, alcohol consumption and medications not known to interact with warfarin were significant in the univariate analysis and were adjusted for when testing for SNP associations. Two regions harbour signals reaching genome-wide significance (Additional file 1 Sheet 4 and Fig. 3a): the lowest P value was observed for rs2288004 (Pâ=â8.76âÃâ10â14) on chromosome 16, an imputed SNP in high LD with VKORC1âs rs9923231 (R2â=â0.98), followed by rs1072753 (Pâ=â2.85âÃâ10â08), an imputed SNP on chromosome 10 in high LD with CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910, R2â=â0.78). After accounting for rs2288004 and rs1072753 and non-genetic factors, no other signal reached genome-wide significance (Fig. 3b). Individuals homozygous for rs9923231 minor allele had an odds ratio of 8.04 (4.43â14.90, Nâ=â83) for having an INR >4.0 during the first week of treatment, while the odds ratio for heterozygous patients was 2.22 (1.34â3.78, Nâ=â287), in comparison to patients homozygous for the major allele (Nâ=â255); similarly, the odds ratio for patients homozygous for rs1057910 minor allele was 24.17 (3.66â644.29, Nâ=â6) and 2.93 (1.70â4.96, Nâ=â74) for heterozygous, reported against homozygous patients for the major allele (Nâ=â545). Two signals not quite reaching genome-wide significance appear in regions of biological relevance to clotting; rs747180 (Pâ=â1.09âÃâ10â06) is located in an intron in APLP2, which has been linked to haemostasis through its inhibitory effect on Factor XIa [24, 25], and rs6809892 (Pâ=â2.94âÃâ10â06) is located near TFRC, a gene implicated in the development of erythrocytes [26].

                      , There were 33 patients with at least one clinical value over three standard deviations from the cohort mean. We repeated all the regression analyses after excluding these outlier patients; this did not significantly alter any of our findings (data not shown)., Non-genetic factors [27] and two main genetic factors [21, 28â32] influence warfarin stable dose, with about 50 % of the variance remaining unexplained. Studies have mainly focused on stable dose, neglecting factors influencing the initial response to warfarin therapy, a period during which patients are at high risk of over- or under-anticoagulation [8, 14]. Our prospective study of 714 British patients undergoing warfarin therapy, from initiation to a 6-month follow-up, has the advantage of being able to capture clinical parameters difficult to assess through a retrospective study design, as well as monitoring a wider range of outcomes, such as patient response at the time of therapy initiation. As this is a prospective cohort, and to be true to the diversity of medical conditions encountered in the clinic, no patients were excluded based on their co-morbidities, no matter how severe. However, removing patients with outlier values for clinical data does not significantly change the results of the regressions., For both MWD and SMWD, we confirm previous findings that VKORC1 and CYP2C9 *2 and *3 are the major genetic determinants of warfarin dose [21, 28â32]. VKORC1 rs9923231 explained between 25.6 % and 30.4 % of the dose variance (MWD and SMWD, respectively), CYP2C9*3 between 8.1 % and 12.9 %, and CYP2C9*2 between 3.7 % and 3.8 %, all in accordance with previous findings [32â37]. Unlike in some previous studies [22, 23] CYP4F2 rs2108622 did not reach genome-wide significance, but retaining it in the model explained 0.5 % of MWD and 1.7 % of SMWD. No other variants reached genome-wide significance in the MWD analysis. Pathway analysis of the top variants post-conditioning for MWD implicated multiple hits in the thrombin signalling pathway, but none of these variants remained in the model after stepwise regression, suggesting that they had little influence on the overall MWD. For SMWD, three variants remained significant after conditioning: while two of them are most probably imputation artefacts, the third signal, rs112942398, looks like a much more plausible signal based on its regional plot. However, this is likely to be an artefact given that its biological relevance is unclear, it has not been picked up by other studies [23, 34], and imputation error rate was high. These data confirm that other genetic factors beyond CYP2C9 and VKORC1 are unlikely to make a strong contribution towards the variance in warfarin dose., In terms of clinical factors for SMWD, these were similar to those previously described in the literature [14, 27, 38, 39], namely age, height, weight and use of interacting co-medications. For MWD, we were able to explore some novel parameters including the follow-up period, which explained up to 1.2 % of the variance in dose, demonstrating the importance of an extended follow-up period on mean weekly dose calculations. Interacting co-medications explained 1 % of the dose variance. Since patients on warfarin are on multiple medications, which may all potentially interact with warfarin, sometimes with opposite effects, we evaluated the sum of these interactions which explained up to 2.2 % of the variance, showing that much greater effect of co-medications can be determined by taking into account the effect of all of them. The number of cigarettes smoked per day explained up to 3.2 % of the variance, similar to that seen by co-medications. It is possible that this effect is mediated through the induction of CYP1A2 by cigarette smoke [40], which metabolises R-warfarin., In the subset of patients with extended clinical data, for the MWD, two clinical factors, on top of age and weight, were of importance and retained after stepwise regression: (a) smoking, rather than the more refined number of cigarettes per day, was highly significant and explained a large portion of the variance at about 10 %; and (b) baseline Factor IX levels explained approximately 4.4 % of the MWD variance, far more than the 0.5 % explained by rs2108622 (CYP4F2). The impact of warfarin on the various clotting factor levels, and how quickly they respond to warfarin, is not clear, and needs further investigation., For INR >4.0 during the first week of treatment, only two genetic factors were important: VKORC1 rs9923231, with odds ratios of 7.9 and 2.23, for homozygous for the minor allele and heterozygous patients, respectively, and CYP2C9*3, with odds ratios of 24.22 and 2.88, respectively. The warfarin loading dose also seems to play an important role in this outcome measure with a univariate P value of 5.9âÃâ10â07 â within our cohort there was variability in loading doses used, ranging from 3 to 32 mg (median: 21 mg, mean: 19.42 mg), adding to the inter-patient variability in warfarin response. Taken together, our data indicate the importance of taking VKORC1 and CYP2C9 genotype into account when determining the loading dose, consistent with our loading dose algorithm [41], which when tested in the EU-PACT trial [11] reduced the risk of patients in the genotype-guided dosing arm having an INR >4.0. Interestingly, known interacting co-medications did not show a significant effect on the outcome INR >4.0, while other co-medications did. The reason for the latter is unclear, as there were medications from many different therapeutic classes present, and thus the most likely explanation is that this is a surrogate for co-morbidities affecting anticoagulation response. This is consistent with a recent cross-sectional study from France which showed that comorbidities worsened the quality of INR control [42]. In patients with extended baseline data, triglycerides and factor VII levels also affected the risk of INR >4.0. Factor VII, a vitamin K-dependent clotting factor, was highly correlated to factor IX. There is lack of knowledge concerning the inter-individual variation in Factor VII levels in response to warfarin. Unfortunately, replication of these results remains impossible at the moment, as no other warfarin study has recorded such a wide range of clinical factors, and/or measured baseline clotting factor levels. Furthermore, given the high cost involved in measuring clotting factor levels, their use in clinic is unlikely. The regulation of clotting factors is most probably complex and the genetic variants involved in such processes are likely to have a low to moderate impact on warfarin response (below 5 % for mean dosing), and thus are unlikely to be included in dosing algorithms unless whole genome sequencing data become incorporated into patient records. Curiously, while ALT was found to contribute significantly to over-anticoagulation during warfarin initiation in a cohort of patients from Asian descent, it was not significant in our INR >4 analysis [43]. It was found to be significantly associated with MWD in our univariate regressions, but was not retained in the final model. On the other hand, it is interesting to note that APOE *Îµ4 was associated with lower warfarin dose in a cohort of Brazilian patients [44], possibly echoing our finding about the influence of triglycerides on over-anticoagulation. Unfortunately, rs429358, one of the two variants, with rs7412, used to code this APOE allele, was neither genotyped not imputed in our cohort, not allowing us to investigate further if this allele was linked to our findings., In conclusion, our analysis shows that multiple factors, genetic and clinical, are important in determining the response to warfarin, which is perhaps not surprising given the pharmacology of warfarin. VKORC1 (rs9923231), CYP2C9 *3 and *2 are the most important genetic factors influencing warfarin dose, with CYP4F2 (rs2108622) having a minor effect, with age and BMI being important clinical covariates. Patientsâ smoking habits and the totality of interacting co-medications, however, also seems to be important when determining warfarin dose. In relation to INR >4 after warfarin initiation, VKORC1 and CYP2C9*3 are important in determining the loading dose, together with alcohol consumption. Realistically, at the present time, it would not be possible to evaluate each of the clinical factors in trials to optimise warfarin dosing. Furthermore, in a randomised design, confounding clinical factors are likely to be balanced between two arms. Thus, the trials which have been undertaken, which take into account CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype, together with age and BMI in determining dosing algorithms, represent pragmatic designs in a Northern European population., Alanine Transaminase, Body Mass Index, Food and Drug Administration, International Normalized Ratio, Minor Allele Frequency, Mean Weekly Dose, Stable Mean Weekly Dose, Single Nucleotide Polymorphism,

                Background
                Large-scale cohort-based whole exome sequencing of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) has identified numerous novel candidate disease genes; however, detailed phenotypic information is often lacking in such studies. De novo mutations in pogo transposable element with zinc finger domain (POGZ) have been identified in six independent and diverse cohorts of individuals with NDDs ranging from autism spectrum disorder to developmental delay.
              
                Methods
                Whole exome sequencing was performed on five unrelated individuals. Sanger sequencing was used to validate variants and segregate mutations with the phenotype in available family members.
              
                Results
                We identified heterozygous truncating mutations in POGZ in five unrelated individuals, which were confirmed to be de novo or not present in available parental samples. Careful review of the phenotypes revealed shared features that included developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, behavioral abnormalities, and similar facial characteristics. Variable features included short stature, microcephaly, strabismus and hearing loss.
              
                Conclusions
                While POGZ has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in large cohort studies, our data suggest that loss of function variants in POGZ lead to an identifiable syndrome of NDD with specific phenotypic traits. This study exemplifies the era of human reverse clinical genomics ushered in by large disease-directed cohort studies; first defining a new syndrome molecularly and, only subsequently, phenotypically.

Variable features included short stature, microcephaly, strabismus and hearing loss., While POGZ has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in large cohort studies, our data suggest that loss of function variants in POGZ lead to an identifiable syndrome of NDD with specific phenotypic traits. This study exemplifies the era of human reverse clinical genomics ushered in by large disease-directed cohort studies; first defining a new syndrome molecularly and, only subsequently, phenotypically., Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) reflect a molecularly and phenotypically heterogeneous classification encompassing intellectual disability (ID), microcephaly, and neurobehavioral traits such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [1]. Collectively, these traits are quite common, with ASD having a prevalence of ~1 % and ID occurring in ~2â3 % of the population. The delineation of various NDDs is not discrete, as more than one phenotype is often present in an individual. Whole exome sequencing (WES) has revealed that mutations in the same gene may be associated with a broad spectrum of neurobehavioral and neurodevelopmental phenotypes [2, 3]., The clinical and genetic heterogeneity of ASD and other neurobehavioral traits represents a challenge for both molecular diagnoses and new gene discovery [4]. ASD is characterized by impairment in social interaction as well as restricted and stereotyped patterns of interest and activities, and is often accompanied by ID and language delay. Recent advances in personal genome analysis and the assembly of large cohorts for study have begun to identify potentially pathogenic variants in individuals with ASD; however, the majority of ASD loci have yet to be identified and may include gene-regulatory mechanisms such as epigenetic modifications and noncoding RNAs [1]. There is emerging evidence for shared genomic underpinnings and genetic etiologies of neuropsychiatric disorders, including ASD, schizophrenia and ID, as evidenced by both WES studies [5] and the mirror trait manifestations of some copy number variants (CNVs) [6]., The over-representation of de novo mutations in affected individuals illustrates the strong genetic basis for NDDs [5, 7, 8]. The prevalence of de novo CNVs has been extensively explored during the past decade, with a large proportion of ASD cases containing these events [9â12]. Moreover, cognitive phenotypes have been tied to CNV in population cohorts [6, 13]. However, despite the known molecular etiology for ~20â30 % of cases, the genetic etiology in the majority of individuals with ASD is presently unable to be identified., Genomic approaches to diagnosis include array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), whole genome sequencing (WGS) and WES. These approaches have identified the genetic etiology of many diverse Mendelian diseases [14]. Recently, large-scale WES studies have been conducted on a number of NDD cohorts [15â20]. These studies have identified many likely pathogenic single nucleotide variants, resulting in the generation of candidate gene lists for neurodevelopmental traits. However, the large number of individuals in cohort publications precludes the reporting of detailed clinical information for each case and often diagnostically relevant dysmorphology is not recognized until a cohort of individuals with a shared genetic etiology is assembled., Premature truncating mutations in pogo transposable element with zinc finger domain, or POGZ (MIM#614787), have been implicated by WES in three ASD cohort studies [16â18], cohorts examining developmental delay (DD) and ID [15, 16] and one schizophrenia cohort [20]. Additionally, a recently published case report details a missense POGZ mutation present in an individual with microcephaly, ASD, ID, and other clinical features [21]. The recurrent identification of POGZ in these studies has robustly implicated POGZ in diverse NDDs, yet no thorough clinical analysis for POGZ variant-associated phenotypic features has been published to date., Although relatively little is known about the function of POGZ, a recent study detailed the interaction of the zinc finger domain of POGZ with HP1Î± and the resultant activation of Aurora B kinase [22]. Therefore, POGZ likely plays a role in mitotic progression through heterochromatin formation and chromosomal segregation, and may also influence gene expression. These functions of POGZ are consistent with the presence of deleterious variants in patients with microcephaly and other neurodevelopmental phenotypes [1]., We have identified five POGZ disrupting mutations in patients with diverse clinical assessments. These individuals have variable NDDs with shared features comprising ID, global DD, behavioral abnormalities, microcephaly, short stature, strabismus, and shared facial characteristics. Together with eight pathogenic mutations from the literature, we describe the spectrum of phenotypes in individuals with deleterious mutations in POGZ. Ascertainment of patients with a shared molecular diagnosis and subsequent phenotypic characterization delineates the clinical presentation common to individuals with POGZ mutations. This genotype-driven approach may be especially relevant for the variable presentations of NDDs, and can be used to further clinically characterize candidate genes identified in diverse cohort studies., This study conforms to the Helsinki Declaration and was performed with approval by the Baylor College of Medicine institutional review board, protocol number H-29697, for all sequencing conducted at the Baylor College of Medicine Human Sequencing Center. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents/legal guardians of the patients for publication of this research and any accompanying images. Exome sequence analysis across all sequencing centers followed the guidelines and process for classifying sequencing variants developed by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics [23]. Trio-based sequencing allowed for the prioritization of de novo loss-of-function mutations in four patients. An average of 2.5 de novo mutations were identified in each proband, of which POGZ was the only truncating allele. Additionally, variants in POGZ were selected for confirmation and co-segregation with the phenotype because loss-of-function mutations in this gene have been found in large cohorts of individuals with neuropsychiatric phenotypes. All identified variants in POGZ have been deposited into ClinVar under accession numbers SCV000256903, SCV000256904, SCV000256905, SCV000256906, and SCV000256907 in agreement with institutional review board approval and patient consent., DNA from patient 1 and her mother was subjected to WES at the BCM Human Genome Sequencing Center through the Baylor-Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics initiative. Exome sequencing and analysis were performed according to previously described methods [24]. Potential de novo mutations were identified in silico by subtracting variants observed in the mother from those observed in patient 1. Candidate variants were filtered against exome data in publicly available databases, including the 1000 Genomes Project, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) database (http://âwww2.âcscc.âunc.âedu/âaric), and our in-house-generated database of approximately 5000 exomes., Patients 2 and 3 were identified through diagnostic WES at the Baylor-Miraca Medical Genetics Laboratory. Sequencing and data analysis were conducted as previously described [25]. Briefly, the average coverage for ~20,000 targeted genes (42 Mb of targeted regions, including untranslated exons) was greater than 100Ã, and more than 95 % of the target bases were covered by at least 20 reads [26]., Patients 4 and 5 were identified via diagnostic exome sequencing at Ambry Genetics (Aliso Viejo, CA, USA). Sequencing and data analysis at Ambry Genetics were conducted as previously described [27]. The mean coverage across the parentâproband trio of patient 4 and patient 5 was greater than 90Ã with >91 % of the targeted bases covered at >20Ã ., PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing to verify all candidate mutations were done according to standard procedures and candidate variants were annotated using the POGZ RefSeq transcript NM_015100.3. Parental samples, when available, were also tested via standard Sanger sequencing., Characteristic clinical findings are summarized in Table 1.Table 1

                                    aPatient 1 was previously reported as patient 2 in Bi et al. [28]
                    , Patient 1 is a 15-year-old female who initially presented in infancy with global DD. She walked at 17 months and her first words were at 18 months. She had a developmental assessment done at 5 years 8 months of age, at which time her motor skills were at age level with a performance IQ of 70, overall IQ of 50, and full scale IQ of 56. Behavioral abnormalities were apparent before 2 years of age, and as she developed, her psychiatric symptoms became more pronounced and included aggressive behavior, self-injury and property destruction that necessitated multiple inpatient psychiatric admissions. Other medical issues included a disturbed sleep cycle that responded to melatonin, mild obstructive sleep apnea, early-onset obesity, and mild myopia. On physical examination at 15 years, her weight was 80.7 kg (97th percentile), height was 152 cm (6th percentile), and head circumference was 52.1 cm (â2 standard deviations). Her body mass index was 34.9 kg/m2 (99th percentile). Facial characteristics include brachycephaly, a long and flat malar region, broad and depressed nasal tip, short philtrum, thin vermillion border, downturned corners of the mouth and pointed chin. She had generalized hypotonia with a mildly wide-based and waddling gait. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalogram, and audiology were normal. She was initially suspected to have Smith-Magenis syndrome due to sleep disturbance and global DD but high-density aCGH for chromosome 17p11.2 was normal. Molecular testing revealed a novel missense variant in RAI1 (NM_030665.3,c.4103A>G, p.S1212G) [28]. This variant was predicted to be benign and polymorphic by PolyPhen-2 and MutationTaster, and is poorly conserved in mammalian evolution. However, the variant was inherited from her father who had a history of learning disability and a personality disorder, and is shared with her sister who had clinical features suggestive of Smith-Magenis syndrome [28]. Thus, we could not conclusively rule out that this missense variant in RAI1 is contributing to the phenotype present in patient 1, but her more severe developmental disability compared with her father and sister warranted further work-up. Additional diagnostic evaluation was noncontributory and included chromosome analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for 22q11.2 deletion, MECP2 sequencing, fragile X testing, lead levels, thyroid function studies, plasma amino acids and urine organic acids. Due to the equivocal interpretation of the RAI1 variant, research exome sequencing was undertaken., Patient 2 is a 31-month-old female with microcephaly, short stature, global DD, non-ocular visual impairment, failure to thrive and multiple congenital abnormalities, including diaphragmatic hernia and a duplicated renal collecting system. Initial echocardiogram showed a patent ductus arteriosus and a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect, which resolved without surgical intervention. Physical examination revealed brachycephaly, sparse hair, low-set and posteriorly rotated ears, long malar region, hypertelorism with downslanting palpebral fissures, a flat nasal bridge, with a broad and depressed nasal tip, short philtrum, thin vermillion border, downturned corners of the mouth, pointed chin, and a short neck with mild webbing. A full psychological and developmental assessment was performed at two years of age. According to the Mullen Scales of Early Learning her visual reception was within the 20th percentile, fine motor was within the 20th percentile, receptive language was within the 20th percentile, and expressive language was within the 20th percentile. According to the Vineland adaptive behavior scales her communication skills were below the first percentile, daily living skills were below the first percentile, socialization was within the first percentile, motor skills were below the first percentile, and adaptive behavior were below the first percentile. Collectively, the results of her formal assessment indicate significant delays across all areas with relative weakness in expressive language skills. Brain MRI showed nonspecific delayed myelination and diffuse T2 hyperintensity. Skeletal anomalies included multiple Wormian bones and mild hypoplasia of the cervical vertebral bodies. Previous work-up included chromosome analysis and aCGH which were normal as well as very long chain fatty acids. A clinical concern for Pallister-Killian was entertained at birth due to facial features and congenital diaphragmatic hernia., Patient 3 is a 3-year 10-month-old male with global DD, complex partial seizures and behavioral abnormalities concerning for ASD. He first presented at two months of age due to poor weight gain and poor suck and latch. At 34 months of age, DAYC-2 formal developmental assessment was administered and he scored a General Developmental Index of 67, interpreted as significantly below age-level across all areas. His full scale IQ at 34 months was 71 (third percentile), verbal comprehension was 85 (14th percentile) and non-verbal abilities were 64 (first percentile). Physical examination revealed strabismus, bifid uvula, a wide space between the central incisors, brachydactyly, large thumbs, broad feet, and large toes. Ophthalmology exam at 12 months of age detected hyperopia and astigmatism. Family history was significant for seizures on the maternal side. He has complex partial seizures localizing to the left frontoparietal area. He was initially treated with phenobarbital but switched to levetiracetam and was well-controlled. Due to concern that this drug was contributing to his behavioral issues, the patient was switched to oxcarbazepine. He developed tic-like movements after the second dose and it was stopped. Topiramate was added and he did start having new seizures while he was on both topiramate and levetiracetam but controlled with higher doses of topiramate. Levetiracetam was eventually weaned and the irritability has improved. Previous work-up was unrevealing and included chromosome analysis, aCGH, metabolic testing, Angelman methylation studies and CREBBP and EP300 testing for Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome I and II., Patient 4 is a 5-year-old female with microcephaly, short stature, global DD, and a history of low muscle tone. Additional medical concerns included feeding difficulties, severe gastroesophageal reflux disease, sensorineural hearing loss, exotropia, and obstructive sleep apnea. Facial characteristics included brachycephaly, a sloping broad forehead, posteriorly rotated ears, upslanting palpebral fissures, long and flat malar region, broad and depressed nasal tip, short philtrum, downturned corners of the mouth, high palate, pointed chin, and relative prognathia. Ophthalmology exam showed exotropia, anisometropia, optic nerve hypoplasia, and rod-cone retinal dystrophy. Brain MRI showed optic nerve hypoplasia with no other structural abnormalities. Skeletal survey was normal other than significant brachycephaly. At age 27 months she underwent a developmental assessment. According to both the Clinical and Auditory Milestones Scale and Cognitive adaptive test she scored at a basal level of 6 months, indicating severe delays across all areas of development with most significant delays to her acquisition of speech and language. Previous molecular testing included aCGH, which revealed a paternally inherited 125-kb copy number gain within chromosome 12q24.12; she had a normal chromosome analysis, an unrevealing targeted microcephaly gene panel, and normal thyroid function studies, plasma amino acids, urine organic acids, and urine mucopolysaccharides., Patient 5 is a 4-year 7-month-old female with microcephaly, cleft palate, global DD, hypotonia and ASD. She presented at birth with cleft palate, micrognathia and a duplicated renal collecting system. Facial and physical characteristics included broad forehead, brachycephaly, broad and depressed nasal tip, short philtrum, thin vermillion border, downturned corners of the mouth, pointed chin, and small hands with relative brachydactyly. Upon her initial clinical presentation additional features were noted, including auditory neuropathy, immune deficiency, and left duplicated renal collecting system. Ophthalmology exam showed exotropia, astigmatism and small optic nerves. Brain MRI revealed Dandy-Walker variant, decreased white matter, and enlarged third and fourth ventricles. Her original exome report identified compound heterozygous variants of unknown clinical significance in STIL, associated with primary microcephaly. Additionally, microarray revealed a paternally inherited Xq21.1 duplication. Previous normal testing included chromosome analysis, FISH for 22q11 deletion, methylation studies for Prader Willi and Angelman syndromes, and ROR2 sequencing. Other testing, all normal, included urine organic acids, serum amino acids, acylcarnitine, and very long chain fatty acids., The clinical description of the individuals in this study overlaps with the descriptions of previously reported patients [15â20]. All five subjects had global DD and/or ID. Behavioral abnormalities ranged from self-injurious behavior to high-functioning ASD. Additional common features included microcephaly (3/5), stature below the tenth percentile (4/5), hypotonia (4/5), strabismus (4/5), vision abnormalities (5/5), sensorineural hearing loss (3/5), and gastrointestinal manifestations including poor feeding, gastroesophageal reflux, and/or constipation (4/5). Recurrent facial and physical characteristics included hypotonic facies with an open mouth, brachycephaly (4/5), long and flat malar region (4/5), posteriorly rotated ears (2/5), broad nasal tip (5/5), flat nasal bridge (3/5), short philtrum (5/5), thin vermillion border (4/5), downturned corners of the mouth (4/5), high arched palate (3/5), and pointed chin (4/5). An overview of clinical features is presented in Table 1. Pictures of the five patients are shown in Fig. 1.

                      , To date, seven de novo mutations leading to premature termination of POGZ have been identified in cohorts of individuals with diverse NDDs, including ASD (Nâ=â3), ID (Nâ=â6), DD (Nâ=â2), or schizophrenia (Nâ=â1) [15â20]. The truncating variants result in termination of the protein prior to or within the C-terminal DDE and/or coiled-coil domains. Additionally, a de novo missense mutation in the CENP-B like DNA binding domain of POGZ was also reported in a child with ASD, ID and dysmorphic features (Fig. 2) [21].

                      , We identified five patients with heterozygous truncating mutations in POGZ. Four of the five variants were confirmed to be de novo in the affected individual; the father of patient 1 was unavailable for analysis but his mother did not harbor the POGZ variant. Extensive testing for each of these individuals was negative, with the exception of a paternally inherited missense variant in RAI1 in patient 1 of uncertain clinical significance [28] and compound heterozygous variants of uncertain clinical significance in STIL in patient 5. We identified heterozygous truncating variants in POGZ in all five individuals by WES; these five variants were validated by Sanger sequencing (Fig. 2). Publicly available databases, including ARIC and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC; version 0.3; Cambridge, MA, USA; http://âexac.âbroadinstitute.âorg) confirmed that the identified variants are unique to our patients. Table 2 provides a molecular description of variants identified in these five patients and eight previously identified cases. Indels resulting in frameshift mutations were present in three of five patients and two of five contained nonsense mutations (one transition and one transversion). Three of the five variants occur in the final exon of POGZ and can potentially escape nonsense-mediated decay. However, the two patients with variants predicted to be subject to degradation by nonsense-mediated decay do not have distinguishing phenotypic features from the three terminal exon-containing patients. All five truncating mutations are predicted to result in the loss of greater than 402 amino acids at the C-terminus of POGZ. Loss of this region of the protein is predicted by conceptual translation to result in deletion of the CENP-B like DNA binding domain, the DDE domain and the coiled-coil domain. Thus, the mutations present in each of the five individuals in this study likely result in loss of function. The assertion that heterozygous loss of function mutations in POGZ cause diverse NDDs is further supported by the presence of two CNVs encompassing POGZ coding regions in the DECIPHER database [29]. The two individuals with small deletions of POGZ are phenotypically described as having DD and additional significant developmental and morphological phenotypes.Table 2

                    , Large cohort studies have associated truncating mutations in POGZ with behavioral abnormalities, ID, and DD [16â21]. The identification of numerous candidate genes in these studies highlights their value. However, to thoroughly describe the clinically relevant phenotypes associated with mutation in a given gene, targeted analyses of a molecularly defined cohort are required. Here, we utilized a genotype-first approach to identify shared facial and physical characteristics as well as the spectrum of individual phenotypes resulting from deleterious mutations in POGZ.
                     , We identified five patients with novel truncating mutations in POGZ, likely resulting in loss-of-function alleles. The description of the five individuals and a review of eight patients from the literature indicate that individuals with mutations in POGZ are likely to have global DD, microcephaly, ID, strabismus and variable hearing loss. Comparison of facial and physical characteristics in our five subjects has revealed shared facial features, including brachycephaly, long and flat malar region, broad nasal tip, short philtrum, thin vermillion border, downturned corners of the mouth and pointed chin (Fig. 1). Patients also present with highly variable neurobehavioral phenotypes, ranging from ASD to severe aggressive behaviors similar to what is seen in individuals with Smith-Magenis syndrome (Table 1)., It is possible that patient 1 and patient 2 may have a blended phenotype; patient 1 has a paternally inherited missense mutation in RAI1, which is associated with Smith-Magenis syndrome. In addition to the characteristic features, patient 2 also presented with congenital abnormalities, including diaphragmatic hernia, a renal tract anomaly, and heart defects. Other than the de novo POGZ mutation, we did not identify additional molecular events that would account for her phenotype. Therefore, although it is possible that POGZ truncating mutations could lead to clinical phenotypes including mild congenital abnormalities, an additional unidentified cause in patient 2 could potentially be responsible for her uncharacteristic presentations. Together, our data and a literature review indicate that damaging variants in POGZ result in a broad range of features distinguished by global DD, ID, neurobehavioral abnormalities (most often ASD), short stature, hypotonia, strabismus, characteristic facial features, including brachycephaly, long and flat malar region, broad nasal tip, short philtrum, thin vermillion border, downturned corners of the mouth, and pointed chin, and variable hearing loss., POGZ has not been extensively characterized; the protein product contains eight canonical C2H2-like zinc finger domains that are implicated in proteinâprotein interactions and have the potential for DNA interactions [30]. The C-terminus of the protein contains a B-like centromere binding domain and a DDE domain (Fig. 2). Interestingly, POGZ interacts with HP1Î± via the zinc finger domain; this activates Aurora B kinase, indicating a potential role for POGZ in mitotic progression and neuronal differentiation [22]. Similar to POGZ, many genes encoding proteins required for proper centrosomal function or chromosome segregation are mutated in patients with microcephaly, demonstrating a common theme of aberrant neuronal proliferation and migration [1, 31]., 
                        POGZ is expressed in developing cortical projection neurons which have been implicated in a network convergence of neurodevelopmental risk genes [32]. HP1Î± also strongly interacts with NIPBL, which is mutated in individuals with Cornelia de Lange syndrome. The overlapping molecular networks of POGZ and NIPBL may indicate common mechanisms of transcriptional dysregulation with deleterious mutation of these genes [24]., Although NDDs are typically a clinical diagnosis, molecular genetic testing, including both aCGH and WES, is capable of more precisely defining syndromes and disorders with highly variable phenotypes [33]. With the expanding number of single-gene candidates for NDDs and the variability of these phenotypes, WES was crucial in defining the cohort of five patients presented here. The increasing emergence of candidate genes for various disorders necessitates genotype-driven approaches for describing associated phenotypic spectrums. Furthermore, with a better understanding of the clinical presentations of patients with deleterious POGZ mutations, more molecular diagnoses may be forthcoming., We report the detailed phenotypic features associated with loss of function variants in POGZ. These include a broad range of features distinguished by global DD, microcephaly, ID, neurobehavioral abnormalities (including ASD), short stature, hypotonia, strabismus and variable hearing loss. We also describe characteristic facial features of this disorder that include brachycephaly, long and flat malar region, broad nasal tip, short philtrum, thin vermillion border, downturned corners of the mouth, and pointed chin. Identification of POGZ variants and subsequent description of characteristic clinical presentations demonstrate the utility of human reverse genetics in an era of personal genome analyses and clinical genomics., Array comparative genomic hybridization, Autism spectrum disorder, Copy number variant, Developmental delay, Fluorescent in situ hybridization, Intellectual disability, Magnetic resonance imaging, Neurodevelopmental disorder, Whole-exome sequencing, Whole-genome sequencing."
